Rather , such assignments are made , as they must be , on the basis of certain overall rules and standards , representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem , taking into account for each situation some of the variables ( e.g. , power and station separations ) and averaging out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck << between >> protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation .
A second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding -- the difference << between >> nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies .
Because of the difference << between >> daytime and nighttime propagation conditions , it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the AM band , with many more stations operating during the day than at night .

With each vertex we associate certain numerical values , namely the set of positive differences in the parameter T << between >> the vertex and its corresponding forward corner points .
Any other point of intersection << between >> C and Af will be called a tangent point .
With the vertex at Af in the C-plane we assume that Af is the parametric location on C of an ordinary intersection Q << between >> C and Af .
In a neighborhood of Q the difference << between >> these functions is also a single-valued , analytic function of U .
Thus if E is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of C and Af near Q , for if there were more than one intersection for every E then the difference << between >> C and Af near Q would not be a monotone function .
The fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and Af are analytic , and therefore the difference << between >> them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point .
We first define a function b{t} as follows : given the set of squares such that each has three corners on C and vertex at t , b{t} is the corresponding set of positive parametric differences << between >> T and the backward corner points .

Here , the choice is that << between >> the horns of a dilemma .
By all means the most important distinction is that << between >> those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution .
By all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference << between >> true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution .
The Cost Section distinguishes << between >> ( directly ) variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter .
Nevertheless , because the Cost Section has felt impelled to make some kind of a distribution of total costs , it has apportioned this residue , which it sometimes calls `` burden '' , << among >> the units of carload traffic on a basis ( partly ton , partly ton-mile ) which is concededly quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination .
But in any event , full credit should be given to the Cost Section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost analyses : namely , that << between >> a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service ; ;
and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads << among >> the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost determination .
We turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which , unlike the `` railroad type '' , draws no distinction << between >> cost allocation and cost apportionment : the single-step type .
As already noted in an earlier paragraph , the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs << among >> a number of major classes of service , such as residential , commercial , industrial power , street lighting , etc. .
and these costs must somehow be apportioned << among >> the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates .

In the first subtype , the analyst ( following the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect ) distributes both total operating costs and total annual capital costs ( including an allowance for `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' ) << among >> the different classes and units of service .
But in the second subtype , which I take to be the one more frequently applied , only the operating expenses and not the `` cost of capital '' or `` fair return '' are apportioned directly << among >> the various classes of service .
To be sure , the capital investments in ( or , alternatively , the estimated `` fair values '' of ) the plant and equipment are apportioned << among >> the different classes , as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services .
There are obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding `` cost of capital '' from the direct apportionment of annual costs << among >> the different classes of service -- notably , the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' .

Pip imagines how Estella would look down upon Joe's hands , roughened by work in the smithy , and the deliberate contrast << between >> her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize the opposition of values between which Pip struggles -- idleness and work , artificiality and naturalness , gentility and commonness , coldness and affection -- in fact , between Satis House and the forge .

The pictures of Figs. 3 and 4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating is detached by failure in a region at , or close to , the interface << between >> coating and substrate .
Consequently , both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring << between >> the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process .
From Fig. 6 the relationship << between >> these parameters can readily be derived and the cutting force is Af where **yl is the shear strength of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material , W is the width of the removed coating and T is its thickness .
The basic difference << between >> the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without fracture , rupture intermittently occurs along the shear plane .
If the rake angle **yc of the knife is high enough and the friction angle **yt << between >> the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low enough to give a positive value for Af , the resultant vector R will lie above the plane of the substrate .
