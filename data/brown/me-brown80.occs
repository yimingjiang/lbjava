Doubts thus inculcated left << me >> floundering for a while and , like some higher critical friends , trying to continue to use the Bible as the Word of God while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations : attempting to bridge the chasm between an older , reverent , Bible-loving generation and a critical , doubting , Bible-emancipated race .

About the Pro Arte's contribution << I >> am less happy .
<< I >> , for one , rather regret that Schnabel didn't collaborate with the Budapest Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group .
There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and << I >> suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original Aj .
Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out , and of these << I >> would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout .
Some of Curzon's playing strikes << me >> as finicky , however .
But having lived with the disc for some time now , << I >> find the performance less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's ( whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good deal less filled with humor than Curzon's .

The rocking , << I >> realized , is the single element in the story that carries the erotic message , the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child's fantasy and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit .
<< I >> am sure that none of the effects of this story were consciously employed by Lawrence to describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood .

Later Helion wrote of this phase : `` For years << I >> built for myself a subtle instrument of relationships -- colors and forms without a name .

`` << I >> arrived in the United States with the idea of establishing myself there more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions '' .
`` Fear possessed << me >> , and the certainty of war '' , he has related .

They have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , << I >> believe , in pointing out Faulkner's independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the Southern tradition .
It is to say rather , << I >> believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique .
The fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern , << I >> rather think , for the South has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity .
The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis Pendleton Gaines showed forty years ago , and << I >> suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed .
It would be profitable , << I >> believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner's time .

Then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , Miriam gave a ghastly echo of Mrs. Micawber by suddenly stating , `` << I >> will never leave Mr. Wright '' .

Mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone , and would note a gown here and there to tell << me >> about that night .
Speaking as a non-Jew << I >> believe that its primary contribution is in the realm of future policy .
As a groundwork for the proposal << I >> give some attention to the first task enumerated above , the clarification of goal .
In any case << I >> do not intend to let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the problem of implementing good intentions .
<< I >> assume that the number of readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is small , and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding of others .
One , a reservation on the point << I >> have just made , is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking , pseudo-feeling , and pseudo-willing , which Fromm discussed in The Escape From Freedom .
And this , << I >> think , holds for values as well as life styles .
after all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) Reader's Digest literature on the `` most unforgettable character << I >> ever met '' deals with village grocers , country doctors , favorite if illiterate aunts , and so forth .
<< I >> do not know that this is true ; ;
<< I >> am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development of conscience -- most of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life , or , for the theologians of course , to the influence of religion .
But there is one in particular which , it seems to << me >> , deserves special attention .
William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks , it seems to << me >> , have a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected : `` For if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation ) -- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affections at all .
Here << I >> do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion .
Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what << I >> mean .
<< I >> would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth .

What << I >> want is to have this evidence come before Congress and if the Attorney General does not report it , as I am very sure he won't , as he has refused to do anything of the kind , I then wish that a committee of seven Representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence .

`` << I >> understand [ Hearst ] is a candidate for Presidential honors '' , Devery said without cracking a smile .
As for the paid Hessians from other states , we are here to instruct the Indiana Democracy in their duty , << I >> have nothing but contempt .
`` << I >> must hurry to catch my train '' .
Another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle of letters that had accumulated for him , saying , `` But Mr. Hearst , what shall << I >> do with this correspondence '' ? ?
`` << I >> should , of course '' , he said , `` like any other man , be honored and gratified should the Democrats see fit to nominate me .
`` I should , of course '' , he said , `` like any other man , be honored and gratified should the Democrats see fit to nominate << me >> .

<< I >> supported Cleveland three times and Bryan twice .
<< I >> intend to support the nominee of the party at St. Louis , whoever he may be '' .
<< I >> stood on a table , surrounded by hundreds of expectant young faces .
Questions came to << me >> from all sides about my world citizenship activities .
After making a short statement about human rights , and the freedom to travel , << I >> told them I would be going to the Kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the Rhine into Germany .

That evening , as << I >> learned later , the students , enjoying that spontaneous immodesty in action known only to university students , surged out onto the streets of Strasbourg , overturning empty streetcars , marking up store fronts , and shouting imprudently , `` Garry Davis to power '' ! !
Alarmed by this display of weapons , << I >> looked toward the bridge and there saw , stretched across the near side , a cordon of policemen , their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several French officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby .
`` Listen please '' , << I >> called to the students in French .
`` << I >> thank you most heartily for being here .
<< I >> ask you all to support me in this .
I ask you all to support << me >> in this .
Your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your understanding of what << I >> am saying .

<< I >> took one step eastward .
One of the uniformed officers stepped in my way , demanding to know whether << I >> had permission to enter Germany .
`` No , << I >> have no permission to enter Germany '' , I told him .
`` No , I have no permission to enter Germany '' , << I >> told him .
<< I >> asked him .
`` << I >> must then be standing on the line between France and Germany '' .
<< I >> mean ''
<< I >> asked .
<< I >> have witnesses .
And as you know , << I >> have no permission to re-enter France once out .
Now << I >> learn I cannot enter Germany .
Now I learn << I >> cannot enter Germany .
Then will you give << me >> a visa to re-enter France '' ? ?
`` Ah , then please tell << me >> where the frontier is because this gentleman here '' -- I indicated the French occupation officer -- `` informs me that Germany is just on the other side of him '' .

Seeing their hesitation , << I >> said , `` Well , until I have permission to enter Germany , or a visa to re-enter France , I shall be obliged to remain here on the line between two countries '' , whereupon I moved to the side of the road , parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on the sidewalk , sat down , took out my typewriter , and began typing the above conversation .

A special guard was posted at my end of the bridge to make sure << I >> didn't cross , the ludicrousness of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else -- men , women , and children , dogs , cats , horses , cars , trucks , baby carriages -- could cross Kehl bridge into Kehl without surveillance .
A volunteer food brigade had been arranged , they told << me >> , which would supply me with the necessities as long as I remained at the bridge .

The Peter family proved wonderful and helpful friends in the following days , Mrs. Peter , little Esther , and Raoul , who generously lent << me >> his sleeping bag for my `` Watch on the Rhine '' .
Sighting a line from the bridge to a small field directly to the side , << I >> pitched the tent that evening on the stateless `` line '' , digging a small trench around it as best I could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood child .

Sure enough , mail began trickling in , delivered by a talkative , highly amused French postman who informed << me >> there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that address would be recognized .
It was a merry if somewhat soggy Christmas for << me >> that year .
Twenty thousand world citizens at Stuttgart had signed a petition inviting << me >> to visit their town .
As it began raining at around eight o'clock on December 26th , << I >> retired into my tent early , somewhat tired and discouraged , my body reacting sluggishly because of the continued exposure .
No matter how large the fire , << I >> couldn't seem to shake off the chill that day .

Esther , mistaking my hesitation , assured << me >> that the hospital expense would be taken care of by a leading merchant in Strasbourg whom she had already approached .
`` No , it's not that '' , << I >> told her .
`` You see , once << I >> relinquish the position I've already established here , I couldn't regain it without sacrificing the logic of it '' .

Luckily both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not << I >> '' .
Consequently , on October 31 , 1896 , Mrs. King wrote to Thompson , quite against her daughter's wishes , asking him not to `` recommence a correspondence which << I >> believe has been dropped for some weeks '' .
<< I >> am a great deal at the little children's Hospital .
<< I >> know you are very busy now , you are writing a great deal & your book is coming out , isn't it ? ?
Perhaps Mrs. Meynell would do << me >> the undeserved kindness to keep my own copy of the first edition of my first book , with all its mementos of her and the dear ones .

This agreeable state of affairs is explicable , << I >> think , on two counts .
For a delightful drive out of Athens << I >> should recommend Sounion , at the end of the Attic Peninsula .
<< I >> suppose the day will inevitably come when the area will be encrusted with developments , but at present it is deserted and seductive .
There is a mediocre restaurant at Sounion and << I >> fed a thin little Grecian cat and gave it two saucers of water -- there was no milk -- which it lapped up as though it were nectar .
<< I >> think its thirst had never been assuaged before .
Norton and << I >> dined one night in a sea-food restaurant in Piraeus right on the water's edge .

After they had paid all his debts and the funeral costs , Ralph and Fred had some fourteen thousand dollars , as << I >> remember , with which to pay the bequests .
Consequently , Fred and Tom , the two who had been provided college educations , signed statements to the effect that each had received his bequest in full , and Effie and << I >> were each allotted $5000 .
Papa , << I >> should emphasize , had been an invalid the last several years of his life ; ;

<< I >> have known Papa to exclaim on getting his tax bill , `` we're going to the dogs '' ! !
<< I >> believe there are seventeen short plays by Tom now housed in the Houghton Library at Harvard ; ;
<< I >> think I'm right in that figure .
In this play there were some thirty or more named characters and << I >> don't know how many more unnamed .
In describing it to Professor Baker after it had been chosen for production , he defended his great array of characters by declaring that he had included that many not because `` << I >> didn't know how to save paint '' , but because the play required them .
Tom told << me >> about it , how one evening he went over to see the Theatre Guild man .

His father was a professor at Hartford Theological Seminary , and from him he acquired a conviction , which he passed along to << me >> , that there is in the universe of persons a moral law , the law of love , which is a natural law in the same sense as is the physical law .

`` << I >> never saw men '' , Lafayette declared in regard to the riflemen , `` so merry , so spirited , and so desirous to go on to the enemy , whatever force they might have , as that small party in this fight '' .
`` They straggle at such a rate '' , he told the commander-in-chief , `` that if the enemy were enterprising , they might get two from us , when we would take one of them , which makes << me >> wish General Howe would go on , lest any incident happen to us '' .

One day Alfred told him that he had decided to leave everything to << me >> .

It happens that I am a legislator from Ohio and that << I >> feel deeply about the needs , the aspirations , the interests of my district and my State .
In the same way << I >> like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community , our district , our State .
And , if we follow the Rayburn pattern , as consciously or by an instinctual political sense << I >> like to think I have followed it , then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country .
And , if we follow the Rayburn pattern , as consciously or by an instinctual political sense I like to think << I >> have followed it , then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country .
It is , << I >> insist , hard to define the Rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated , and because it goes so deep .
<< I >> pray to God that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United States and the whole world can ill afford to lose .
Of this << I >> am proud .
<< I >> have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carries his greatness .
<< I >> pay my personal tribute to Sam Rayburn , stalwart Texan and great American , not only because today he establishes a record of having served as Speaker of the House of Representatives more than twice as long as Henry Clay , but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half century of service as a Member of Congress .
No greater pleasure has come to << me >> in my own service in this House than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great Speaker , this great legislator , this great Texan , this great American .
<< I >> prefer to speak , however , of Sam Rayburn , the person , rather than Sam Rayburn , the American institution .
On September 16 , Sam Rayburn will have served as Speaker twice as long as any predecessor and << I >> am proud to join with others in marking this date , and in expressing my esteem for that notable American , Sam Rayburn .

and now , therefore , do << I >> , John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Monday , May 22nd , 1961 , as National Maritime Day , reminding our citizens that American Merchant ships and American seamen are ready at all times to serve our Nation in the cause of freedom and justice .

and now , therefore , do << I >> , John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of June 11th to 17th , 1961 , as Miss Rhode Island Pageant Week , with deep appreciation to the Jaycees , local and statewide , for the presentation of their beautiful Pageants and the encouragement of all Rhode Island girls to participate .
In testimony whereof , << I >> have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 11th day of June , in the year of Our Lord , one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one , and of Independence , the one hundred and eighty-sixth .
and now , therefore , do << I >> , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Tuesday , October 24th , 1961 , as United Nations day , calling upon all our citizens to engage in appropriate observances , demonstrating faith in the United Nations and thereby contributing to a better understanding of the aims of the United Nations throughout the land .
and now , therefore , do << I >> , John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of Monday , November 13 , 1961 , as the State Ballet of Rhode Island Week , requesting all Rhode Islanders to give special attention to this unusual event which should contribute to the cultural life of the State .

<< I >> am pleased to note that Mr. Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the board of the New York Times .
<< I >> should like at this time , Mr. Speaker , to pay warm tribute to Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Charles Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism .
The people of the 17th District of New York , and << I >> as their Representative in Congress , take great pride in the New York Times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world .
Yesterday , << I >> had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U.S. News & World Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its disadvantages .
efforts , as << I >> see it , which are being directed , by the way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past .
Personally , << I >> think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba .
<< I >> am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed .
But in any event , << I >> submit that the power to depose belongs to Congress , not to this Court .
What << I >> am suggesting is that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties .
<< I >> also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas -- an affliction of all bureaucracies .
<< I >> hope no one expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas .
Further , << I >> would hope that we could pay attention to little things .
While observing the operations of our Government in various parts of the world , << I >> have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort .
<< I >> would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them .
<< I >> tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces .
May << I >> add a caution on this particular point ? ?
<< I >> doubt , for example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan , any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals .
<< I >> recommend to the Congress the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps -- a pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower .
<< I >> have today signed an Executive Order establishing a Peace Corps on a temporary pilot basis .
<< I >> have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare .
<< I >> strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity .
<< I >> again proposed a reduction in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve -- from their present strengths of 400,000 and 300,000 , respectively , to 360,000 and 270,000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961 .
<< I >> endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates .
In the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , << I >> recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 ) .
As << I >> have stated previously , the Attorney General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles .
As I have stated previously , the Attorney General has advised << me >> that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles .
Accordingly , if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session , << I >> shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise .
As << I >> have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known as the Buy American Act .
<< I >> am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 ( the B-52H with the new turbofan engine ) and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber , together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case .
And lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report , let << me >> enlighten them with the truths that , under Communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the Foundation , and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed , untrammeled in every way , toward their discoveries , their creative efforts for the good of mankind .
It must have been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12 , 1848 , Joseph Brown made the momentous entry in his job book , in his characteristically cryptic style , `` Lucian Sharpe came to work for << me >> this day as an apprentice '' .
<< I >> believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 .
<< I >> would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 - 15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison , with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will .
<< I >> look for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.7 million sets for the year , but I look for some decline in radios from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.0 - 15.5 million sets .

While this may well be true in general , << I >> believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions .
Although the impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be gradual , on balance << I >> look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year , to at least $6 billion .
For the near term , however , it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market , and for this reason << I >> would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years ; ;
Production totalled about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959 , and << I >> look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961 .
In sum , << I >> look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion , despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally .
As << I >> have indicated above , I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year , but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960 ; ;

Similarities to the approach which << I >> have described are evident in the prompt establishment of a helping relationship , quick appraisal of key issues , and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the essential dynamics in helping to further the ego's coping efforts in dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses .

A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used to often seclude herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door -- as << I >> would find on passing by , between our sessions -- for all the world like two persons , a scolding mother and a defensive child .
and only when << I >> can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient's behavior .
For example , one hebephrenic man used to annoy << me >> , month after month , by saying , whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion -- as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank you '' to him at the end of each session .

Eventually it became clear to << me >> , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor sufferer again on the morrow .

Another patient , a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not only << me >> but the ward-personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met .
Or an `` << I >> want to go home '' , or whatever -- but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning .
As << I >> have been intimating , in the schizophrenic -- and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic ; ;
this is a question which << I >> have no wish to take up -- condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well sorted out , but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well differentiated from one another .
Recently , for example , a paranoid woman's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid-twentieth-century human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that << I >> was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was .

In << I >> know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; ;
in one thing << I >> know it will usually be on the predicator know .
In << I >> have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress than do .
In << I >> know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing .
In << I >> knew you when you were a child , and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that the young woman spoken to is still pretty .

For Yokuts , << I >> tabulated these 71 items in five columns , according as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more than 4 stems .
<< I >> was at least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication , in which , in listing ' Two-Stem Meanings ' , I set off by asterisks those forms in which N of stem B was Af of stem A/3 , the unasterisked ones standing for Af ; ;

or under ' Four Stems ' , << I >> set off by asterisks cases where the combined N of stems Af was Af .
If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as << I >> am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? ?
<< I >> would propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible .
My answer is in the negative because << I >> believe that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press against available supplies , and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels .
There are serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising Federal expenditures , of which << I >> take a dim view , but it seems very likely to occur .
In a more pessimistic vein about the economic outlook , << I >> suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing which was dammed-up during the Thirties and World War 2 , is finally in the process of running dry .
The growers have strenuously argued that << I >> should have accepted the Superior Court decisions as conclusive and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the Secretary's Regulation .
<< I >> cannot accept that view , either as a lawyer or as an administrator .
But over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent decision , << I >> am convinced that the decisions of the Superior Courts which in effect nullify the Secretary's Regulation are not a correct interpretation of the Secretary's power under the Federal law .
The public interest is so dominant in such an issue that << I >> cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two Superior Courts in the State .
Because of the uncertainty of this definition , << I >> solicited the interpretation of the Secretary of Labor .

On the positivist theory , everything << I >> sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second .
The suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake , because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering , seems to << me >> merely frivolous .
So far as << I >> can see , there is only one way out for the positivist .
This way of escape is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so far as << I >> know , been urged by positivists , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it .

<< I >> am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the U.S.S.R. .
I am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to << me >> your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the U.S.S.R. .
<< I >> can well understand your curiosity .
Pozzatti and << I >> endeavored earnestly to record our impressions without the prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes .
The time-span of little more than a month cannot entitle << me >> to pose as an expert on anything I saw .
The time-span of little more than a month cannot entitle me to pose as an expert on anything << I >> saw .
If this attitude is seriously questioned in the Soviet Union , it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which << I >> live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view .
It is a matter of some disappointment to << me >> that still many of my own countrymen are too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the plight of a minority , such as artists , in any social order .
<< I >> encountered many questions and great interest upon my return from the Soviet Union about my reactions to that experience .
That which << I >> found most profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction .
<< I >> cannot be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat unusual travelogue .
<< I >> am equally impatient with the shrug of the shoulder , shake of the head of those who no longer care because they have known it for so long ; ;
Difficult as it may have been at times , Pozzatti and << I >> saw enough , talked to enough artists , historians and others to realize that the issue is quite clear .
These two recollections form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which , to << me >> at least , symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between materialism and humanism .
<< I >> could not bring myself to answer that `` some of my best friends are non-propagating mules '' .
No wonder that Pozzatti and << I >> had at times difficulty in remembering the real purpose of our presence , namely , Cultural Exchange .
<< I >> can only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion .
It was only after we had responded , with what << I >> fear were similar cliches , that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and warlike actions by the U.S. Government in Cuba and Laos .
Pozzatti and << I >> could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in Moscow than elsewhere .
Until our Moscow experience , << I >> had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or informally .
and , furthermore , << I >> could not presume the implication that I spoke for American artists as a group .
and , furthermore , I could not presume the implication that << I >> spoke for American artists as a group .
<< I >> mention these features of the book because they are inherent in the book's character and therefore must be mentioned .
Since << I >> have already discussed his moral position , that discussion is incorporated by reference into the following pages , which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of Fromm's treatment .
<< I >> shall first indicate a couple of weaknesses in Fromm's analysis , then argue that , granted these weaknesses , he still has much left that is valuable , and , finally , raise the general question of a philosophical versus a sociological approach to the question of alienation .
<< I >> am not suggesting that Fromm ought to do this kind of work .
Nor do << I >> think that alienation is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual .
The only other one << I >> shall mention here is his use of the term capitalism .
<< I >> cite it as evidence that he did not develop through new styles as he grew older ( as Yeats did ) , but that he simply learned to use better what he already had .
Living in San Francisco << I >> saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue .
So as the years passed , << I >> saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration .
The last time << I >> saw Bird , at Jimbo's Bob City , he was so gone -- so blind to the world -- that he literally sat down on me before he realized I was there .

The last time << I >> saw Dylan , his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality .
<< I >> do not believe that this is due to anything especially frightful about their relationship to their own creativity .
As the world began to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas oven , << I >> believe his art became meaningless to him .
<< I >> think all this could apply to Parker just as well , although , because of the nature of music , it is not demonstrable -- at least not conclusively .
<< I >> want to make clear what I consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts .
I want to make clear what << I >> consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts .
<< I >> doubt if anyone holds such ideas today .
In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which << I >> believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative .
Almost the first step in the corruption of Pip's values is the unworthy shame he feels when Estella cruelly remarks the coarseness of his hands : `` They had never troubled << me >> before , but they troubled me now , as vulgar appendages '' .

When the snobbery that alienates Pip from Joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love , the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake at which Pip exclaims : `` No , don't wipe it off -- for God's sake , give << me >> your blackened hand '' ! !
We first see him shaking Mrs. Joe's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the premium paid to her husband for Pip's indenture as an apprentice and later pumping Pip's hands `` for the hundredth time at least '' ( `` May << I >> -- may I -- '' ? ?

She said , `` << I >> notice the girl from across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit '' .
`` << I >> imagine you're always battling in school '' .
`` << I >> don't go to school any more '' .
`` << I >> think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little .
`` That doctor annoys << me >> '' .
`` << I >> mean , do you feel like seeing Kate '' ? ?
Scotty said , `` << I >> don't know '' .
Or : `` << I >> walk around the house a lot '' .
And another time , without accusation : `` You never wore that scarf << I >> bought you '' .
Then we pull out under our mortar and artillery cover , but nobody pulls out until << I >> say so .
Remember what << I >> said about going out to get anybody left behind ? ?
`` Give << me >> your machine gun ammo '' .
I'm used to all three , but << I >> think the French have the healthiest attitude '' .
<< I >> think , too '' , he said , his dark eyes mischievous , `` that you will find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you have spoken '' .
Mickie had a pleasant glow as he said , `` You see , both of them , << I >> mean the President and Jeff Lawrence , are romantics .
<< I >> heard of some that tried it back in the States , and he'd knock them clear across the room .
The Colonel ordered that it be wiped out , and << I >> suggested , ' You ask for volunteers , and promise each man on the patrol a quart of whisky , ten dollars and a week-end pass to Davao .
The colored boy had it , and Trig lunged at him with a knife and said , ' Give that to << me >> , you black bastard .
When he was in the war , he was in Law or Supplies or something like that , and an old buddy of his told << me >> he would come down on Sundays to the Pentagon and read the citations for medals -- just like the one we sent in for Trig -- and go away with a real glow .
He said to the Secretary , `` << I >> understand you came from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre .
The Vice President said , `` If you hear of any names that would fix << me >> cheap in return for advertising they decorated the Vice President's home , let me know .
The Vice President said , `` If you hear of any names that would fix me cheap in return for advertising they decorated the Vice President's home , let << me >> know .

`` Reverend '' , he said , `` << I >> think you don't quite understand the situation here .
Tenements , stores , saloons , some gambling , << I >> hope not too much .

Sonuvabitch , << I >> can't figure out what in hell for they went and put niggers in my squad for .
`` << I >> soon came back to my senses '' , he said , aloud , to the young blizzard , proudly , drawing himself up , as if making a report to some important superior .
<< I >> was the first to get my squad on the ball , and anybody thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb .
He kept sayin , not << me >> , not me , I don't wanta wind up like em .

Then he was asking himself the usual early morning questions : What the Hell am << I >> doin here ? ?
Am << I >> nuts ? ?

`` Don't Christsake << me >> , buddy ! !

`` I'm dressed as << I >> always am '' , Rousseau said .

but this grinning , broken head , not ten feet away from << me >> , was the sharp definition of what my reality had become .
<< I >> must state that the faster things happened , the slower they happened ; ;
the passage and rhythm of time changed , and when << I >> remember back to what happened then , each event is a separate and frozen incident .
<< I >> had squeezed the trigger of my own gun , and to my amazement , it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule ; ;

<< I >> use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship .
<< I >> felt it and it ate on me all the time , but I didn't know how right I was till later .

I felt it and it ate on me all the time , but I didn't know how right << I >> was till later .
What << I >> did know was that Precious was always around .
You wouldn't have << me >> throw the poor boy out on the street '' , Eileen said when I needled her about it .

Still << I >> didn't think she was twotiming me with Precious right then .
Still I didn't think she was twotiming << me >> with Precious right then .
Precious had << me >> worried .
<< I >> couldn't make out what his racket was .
He was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to << me >> there was something tough under his selfeffacing manner .
<< I >> never could find out what his business was .
`` Connections '' was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when << I >> put leading questions .
Occasionally if << I >> pushed him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his .

`` Some day '' , << I >> told Eileen , `` that guy will kill us both '' .
Getting drunk every night was the only way << I >> could handle the situation .
The way Eileen and << I >> were hitting it up , we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening .
<< I >> don't know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer hadn't come to town .
Pat took Eileen and << me >> out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again .
How about << me >> trying to help her get her job back ? ?
`` But brother << I >> can't take a job right now '' , she said with her eyes on her ice cream , `` I'm going to have a baby , Francis Xavier's baby , my own husband's baby '' .
My first thought was how had it happened so soon , but << I >> counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd been living together six weeks .
Before he left town Pat saw to it that << I >> was fixed up with a job .
There << I >> was a retired wobbly and structural iron worker who'd never gouged a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement .
Sposato couldn't wait to get << me >> hired .
`` << I >> guess it will be all right .
`` << I >> will be expecting them '' .
`` << I >> beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers '' , he said .
`` << I >> should say about a hundred thousand '' , Fletcher said .
`` << I >> would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon '' , Rector said , He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create , the picture of a very busy mission .
`` << I >> would like them to appear very busy today , not busy exactly , but joyous , exuberant , full of life .
<< I >> want to create the impression of a compound full of children .
`` << I >> think I've fixed the pump so we won't have to worry about it for a long time '' , he said .
`` When Konishi gets back with the jeep , << I >> want you to round up two or three Japanese boys .
`` Tomorrow will be a new experience -- << I >> have never before made love to a nightingale .
There have been cooing doves , chattering magpies , thieving jackdaws , a proud peacock , a silly goose , and a harpy eagle -- whom << I >> was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals '' .
`` We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney , milord , but << I >> promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again '' .
That would be Minerva , << I >> suppose .
`` Tell << me >> about Minerva , how she behaved , what she did to please you '' .
<< I >> don't ask you who 'tis you're being unfaithful to , husband or lover .
Frankly , << I >> don't care '' .
What matter the others so long as << I >> have my place in history '' .
`` << I >> was told it on good authority '' , Claire answered darkly .
`` << I >> promised him I wouldn't '' .
`` I promised him << I >> wouldn't '' .
`` And in the future , since << I >> write for a public of one , I can save the poor publishers from wasting their money '' .
`` And in the future , since I write for a public of one , << I >> can save the poor publishers from wasting their money '' .
-- Fetch << me >> the copies of everything B and C companies have requisitioned in the last six months .
<< I >> want to take a look .
If my pass is approved , << I >> may be a half hour .
-- Let << me >> help him , for the love of God ! !
-- Henry said that he'd take my arm and get << me >> right there .
-- Why , course << I >> can .
<< I >> can walk real good .
<< I >> wish you was Henry .
He promised to take << me >> .
<< I >> would not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming , `` O Gogol , O Chekhov , O Thackeray and Dickens , what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris ducks , a birdbath , and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps '' ? ?
<< I >> can see it from this window where I write .
I can see it from this window where << I >> write .
It bulks under a veil of thin , new grass , like some embarrassing fact of physicalness , and << I >> think Mrs. Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning .
Offer her a cup of tea and she would say , `` Why , these cups look just like a set << I >> gave to the Salvation Army last year '' .
Show her the new swimming pool and she would say , slapping her ankle , `` << I >> suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes '' .
`` << I >> did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans .
<< I >> want to get my kit in tomorrow morning -- would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner '' ? ?
I want to get my kit in tomorrow morning -- would you mind doing them while << I >> cook the dinner '' ? ?
`` But << I >> don't know the Flannagans '' , Charlie Pastern said .
`` Nobody does , but they gave << me >> ten last year '' .
`` And << I >> am not sure that I have any cash -- any money , that is -- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook .

`` << I >> am terribly sorry to keep you waiting '' , she said , `` but won't you make yourself a little drink while you wait ? ?
`` I'll have a drink , then , if you'll have one with << me >> '' .
`` << I >> had a drink with the Flannagans '' .
`` She told << me >> he was in Germany '' .
`` Please come down as soon as you conveniently can '' , the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen , `` << I >> have an important matter to discuss with you '' .
To Abel : `` << I >> am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here .
<< I >> should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters .
`` You remember them , << I >> suppose '' ? ?
<< I >> hope Raphael bought them whole '' .
`` Yes '' , she said , `` << I >> remember that they came here every summer .

`` << I >> suppose it has to do with the property '' , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters .
`` She's probably getting old -- crotchety , << I >> mean -- and we figured uh-uh , better not .
<< I >> feel kind of bad about it '' .
`` << I >> imagine the old girl hasn't missed us much '' , Mark added , his eyes on the road .
<< I >> decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I couldn't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling .

<< I >> didn't hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen .
He was all shoveled up like << I >> thought he'd be .
<< I >> think his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except to roll a little when I shoved him .
I think his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except to roll a little when << I >> shoved him .
The covers slid down his skinny neck so << I >> saw his head , fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall -- there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster -- and I thought , Well you don't look much like a pig-drunk bully now .

`` Big Hans sent << me >> .
He told << me >> to wake you '' .
`` << I >> ain't hid nothing in the crib '' .
`` << I >> goddamn well understand '' .
`` << I >> goddamn well understand .
You know << I >> don't want to see Pedersen .
Why should << I >> ? ?
`` Big Hans made << me >> come .
<< I >> taught him , dammit , and I'll teach you .

He was about to get up so << I >> got out , slamming the door .
<< I >> always felt the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out .
<< I >> heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs .
`` Listen to << me >> , Jorge , I've had enough to your sassing .
If << I >> don't get some whisky down him he might die .
He don't care , and << I >> don't care to have his shit flung on me .

`` I'll get more snow '' , << I >> said .
<< I >> took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch .
<< I >> thought she'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had .
She had surprised Hans like she had surprised << me >> when she said she'd go , and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat .

`` I'd give anything if << I >> could have found a girl like you '' .
`` Why , << I >> couldn't even cook a piece of antelope steak ; ;

<< I >> want to roast the whole thing , and have it for the boys '' .

`` Chickens have short memories '' , the doctor remarked , `` that's why they are better company than most people << I >> know '' , and he went on to break some important news to Alex .
`` Well '' , he began , `` It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from << me >> than those fellers over at the conference house do .
`` Leave << me >> alone '' , Leona said .
`` This is moving day '' , Winston reminded her , `` and << I >> bet you left things every which way upstairs , your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made .

`` How many times have << I >> told you '' -- he began , and was almost glad when she cut him off -- `` Too many times '' ! !
`` << I >> don't know what you think you've been doing about my clothes '' , he said .
`` What possessed you to tell << me >> a clotheshorse would be a good idea '' ? ?
every morning , << I >> lay out his clothes on it '' .

`` << I >> don't know '' .
`` Lovie , you make << me >> feel naked '' .
`` You look like that picture << I >> have at the office '' , Mr. Jack had started .
`` Darling , << I >> love that photograph .
After a minute he went on , `` People must think the curse is on << me >> , seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray '' .

During the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster casts and spatter prints of Catskill flowers and leaves was all but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions of Jessica that my mind served up to << me >> for contemplation and delight .
Nothing in all the preceding years had had the power to bring << me >> closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world .

In final separation from them , in the railroad terminal across the river from New York , << I >> would nearly cry .
<< I >> lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer .
My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited << me >> to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when ; ;
Then epistolatory << me >> was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after-school class I was enrolled .

The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which << I >> was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot Sands -- he of the porch steps anecdotes -- who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them .
Like Eliot , in my fantasies , << I >> had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night's climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love .

They caused my love for Jessica to become warmer and at the same time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring << me >> the courage to ask to see her again .
Having received permission to give a camp reunion-Halloween party , she asked that << I >> come and be her date .
Again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates , << I >> was shy with Jessie and acted as I had during those early Saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing for effect , to be detached and unconcerned with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom , later , in the privacy of our bunks , we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance .

At five o'clock that night it was already dark , and behind my closed door << I >> was dressing as carefully as a groom .
<< I >> wore a new double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapels like a devil's ears .
My camp-made leather wallet , bulky with twisted , raised stitches around the edges , << I >> stuffed with money I had been saving .

Times Square , when << I >> ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members ) , was nearly impassable , the sidewalks swarming with celebrants , with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey .
An old gentlemen next to << me >> held a Boy Scout bugle to his lips and blasted away at every fourth step and during the interim shouted out , `` V for Victory '' ! !
Was << I >> supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for Jessica ? ?
It was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed << me >> up among the other gallants who had established the Astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch their night of merrymaking .

But when I saw that it was already ten past seven , << I >> began to wonder if something had gone wrong .
<< I >> grew uneasy .
Whole platoons were taking up new positions on the steps , arriving and departing , while << I >> stayed glued , like a signpost , to one spot .
At 7:25 two hotel doormen came thumping down the steps , carrying a saw-horse to be set up as a barricade in front of the haberdashery store window next to the entranceway , and as << I >> watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground , their golden , fringed epaulets and spic , red-visored caps , I suddenly saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making her way through the crowd .

<< I >> suddenly thought of Mary Jane Brennan , the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger , her quiet competence , the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses .
She knew that << I >> lived at a good address on the Gold Coast , that I had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies .

`` Why should << I >> ? ?
<< I >> wanted to go to college , too '' --
`` That's what << I >> mean about you , Anderson '' , she said .
<< I >> think it's a good deal .
I'm going to become a good nurse , and I've got two baby brothers that are going to have college if << I >> have to work at my profession until I'm an old maid to give it to them '' .
<< I >> asked .
`` My father and mother died when << I >> was two years old '' , I said .
`` My father and mother died when I was two years old '' , << I >> said .
`` My aunt raised << me >> .
Aunt Mary died when << I >> was doing my military service .

`` << I >> don't know what I'd do without my family .
Listening , << I >> felt cheated and lonely as only an orphan can .
When she had finished << I >> said :
<< I >> don't think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd decided not to be a rumdum in the future '' .
`` If << I >> thought you were serious about going back to school , that you'd learned something from your experiences here and at Hanover -- well , I might consider such an offer .

It suddenly seemed very important to << me >> that Mary Jane Brennan should know the truth about me -- that I was not the confused , sick , irresponsible person she believed me to be .

As for that other girl , let's just say that << I >> never want to see her again .
`` We'll go up to the Edgewater Beach Hotel for dinner '' , << I >> said .
`` << I >> like to dance '' , she said , then turned and walked away .
There hadn't been anything really personal in her interest in << me >> .
<< I >> knew that .
Now , riding this hospital bus , feeling isolated and utterly alone , << I >> knew that she was genuine and unique , quite unlike any girl I had known before .
Now , riding this hospital bus , feeling isolated and utterly alone , I knew that she was genuine and unique , quite unlike any girl << I >> had known before .
It seemed the most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about << me >> .
Only two people in the state of Illinois knew that << I >> was entering Hanover State Hospital under an assumed name , or why .
But << I >> had the proof , all documented in a legal agreement which I would show her the moment I was free to do so .

As the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward Hanover << I >> settled back in my seat and closed my eyes , thinking over the events of the past two weeks , trying to put the pieces in order .
<< I >> wondered suddenly as I listened to the disconnected jabberings coming from the patient behind me , if I had not perhaps imagined it all .

<< I >> had come to Chicago from New York early in September with a dramatic production called Ask Tony .
Out of the entire cast << I >> alone received good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer .
<< I >> felt lonely and depressed as I packed my bags at the Croydon Hotel .
I felt lonely and depressed as << I >> packed my bags at the Croydon Hotel .
It seemed to << me >> that my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another .
<< I >> had been among the top third in my class at N.Y.U. , had wanted desperately to go to medical school , but I'd run out of money and energy at the same time .
It seemed to << me >> that I was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well .
It seemed to me that << I >> was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well .
<< I >> knew that I'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at Union News or Schraffts while waiting for another acting job to open .
It suddenly occurred to << me >> that I did not particularly like acting , that I was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what I was going to do with my life .

<< I >> closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy to pick up , then went to the bathroom for a drink of water .
When << I >> answered it a voice too dignified and British to be real said , `` Is this Mr. Dale Nelson , the actor '' ? ?
`` All right '' , << I >> said .
`` << I >> beg your pardon , sir '' ? ?
<< I >> smiled .
<< I >> started to say something else appropriate , but the man had hung up .
They all bowed low as << I >> approached them .
`` All right , you bastards '' , << I >> said , `` the great actor is about to buy a drink '' .
<< I >> laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round .
He had just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page << me >> .
<< I >> was giving the parked cars the once-over .
<< I >> walked with him back to the entrance .
He gave << me >> a ticket on the agency car and parked it .
<< I >> was back in ten minutes .
`` Forgot to get something out of the car '' , << I >> told him , showing him my ticket .
You're the one << I >> was talking to about a monthly rental .
`` That's right '' , << I >> told him .
<< I >> went back to the agency car and got out an electric bug , one of the newest devices for electronic shadowing .
<< I >> always keep a set in the car .
<< I >> put in new batteries so as to be certain I'd have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at them thoughtfully .
<< I >> waited until the parking attendant was busy with a customer , then slipped around the back of the car with license number JYM 114 , attached the electronic bug to the rear bumper and walked out .
<< I >> waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office building .
<< I >> wasn't far behind him when he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car .
`` << I >> haven't made up my mind yet '' , I said .
`` I haven't made up my mind yet '' , << I >> said .
<< I >> have a couple of them I'm figuring on ; ;
<< I >> kept trying to get him to take my money .
`` Okay '' , << I >> told him .
<< I >> know where the car is .
<< I >> grinned at him , handed him a couple of dollars and said , `` By the time you get the parking charge figured up , there should be a cigar in it for you '' .
<< I >> hurried over to the agency heap , jumped in , started the motor and was just in time to see the car I wanted to shadow turn to the left .
I hurried over to the agency heap , jumped in , started the motor and was just in time to see the car << I >> wanted to shadow turn to the left .
<< I >> was held up a bit trying to make a left turn .
<< I >> turned on the electric bug , and the signal came in loud and clear .
<< I >> made time and picked him up within ten blocks .
<< I >> stayed half a block behind him , letting lots of cars keep in between us , listening to the steady beep beep beep .
If it ever got behind << me >> , the beep turned to a buzz .
<< I >> turned left too soon and got a signal showing that I was still behind him but he was to the right .
I turned left too soon and got a signal showing that << I >> was still behind him but he was to the right .
After a while the signal became a buzz and << I >> knew he was behind me .
After a while the signal became a buzz and I knew he was behind << me >> .
<< I >> found a parking place half a block away , sat in the car and waited .
<< I >> circled the block and found he was in the parking lot of a high-class restaurant .
<< I >> sat there with the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and occasionally catching the aroma of coffee .
<< I >> remembered it was the Peeping Tom place .
The card the man << I >> was shadowing had filled out was still on the counter .
<< I >> noticed that he was in Unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of Oscar L. Palmer and wife , giving a San Francisco address .
<< I >> used the alias of Robert C. Richards , gave the first three letters and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency heap , but a couple of phony numbers in between .
<< I >> could have written anything .
`` << I >> don't think so '' .
<< I >> asked .
`` Thank you '' , << I >> told her .
<< I >> took another sidelong glance at the other registration card , then took the key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car .

I put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side << I >> wanted to case .
With the aid of that << I >> could hear my man moving around , heard him cough a couple of times , heard the toilet flush , heard the sound of water running .
<< I >> was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed .
<< I >> had noticed a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile .
The powerful microphone << I >> could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation , and I was positively nauseated I was so hungry .

<< I >> got in the car , drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers with everything included , a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible .
The place wasn't particularly busy at that time of night , and the girl who was waiting on << me >> , who was clothed in the tightest-fitting pair of slacks I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was -- and there was lots of it -- wanted to be sociable .

`` There may not be any women left '' , << I >> said .
`` I'll be here at ten-fifty-five '' , << I >> said .
<< I >> said `` Darn it , that's the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on .
<< I >> didn't turn it off '' .
<< I >> reached over and switched off the electronic bugging device .
Then << I >> shut off the device again .
She wanted to hang around while << I >> was eating .
`` No '' , << I >> said .
She looked at << me >> provocatively .
<< I >> turned on the device again , half fearful that I might find silence , but the buzzes came in loud and clear .

With his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened , saying , `` Uh-huh '' and `` << I >> see '' at intervals .
At the time the will was drawn Mr. Hohlbein mentioned to << me >> how mentally alert she seemed for her age , knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth '' .

`` Can << I >> tell you a secret ? ?

`` You took a picture of << me >> at the corner of Washington and Blake about three thirty this afternoon '' .
`` << I >> wouldn't even want it to get around '' .
`` << I >> was hired to take a picture .
<< I >> took it .
`` Maybe you'd better tell the guy who hired you what << I >> said '' .
`` But << I >> meant what I said , Casey .
`` But I meant what << I >> said , Casey .
You don't know << me >> but I know you .
You don't know me but << I >> know you .
It's at the far end of the county and the last time << I >> came here was for a hit and run manslaughter -- about seven months ago .
Seeing << me >> he said with real surprise , `` Well , well , ain't we honored ! !
Took << me >> 19 years to become Chief of our three man police force .
`` << I >> guess it helps '' , I said , paying no attention to his ribbing .

`` About nine this morning Mrs. Buck phones << me >> she's having trouble with one of her farm hands -- money trouble .
Anyway , Julia asks << me >> to .
Julia Buck , the deceased '' , Moore said , slipping << me >> his smug , idiot-grin again .
`` Julia asks << me >> to come out at once .
<< I >> would have come sooner if I'd known .
No doubt about Tim being the killer -- << I >> have a witness .
Told them << I >> can handle this '' .
Swears she recognized his voice , that Tim yelled , ' It's my money and << I >> want it ' ! !
Then she heard Julia phone << me >> .
Pulling back the sheet , << I >> examined the bruises around Julia Buck's once slender throat .
<< I >> dropped the sheet , glanced at my watch .
It was almost one and << I >> hadn't had lunch .
Still , << I >> wanted to get this over with , had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office .
<< I >> told him , `` I want to go see the Buck house '' .
I told him , `` << I >> want to go see the Buck house '' .
Walking back down Main Street , << I >> said , `` I saw the Harbor's one squad car at the road block , we'll ride out in my car '' .
Walking back down Main Street , I said , `` << I >> saw the Harbor's one squad car at the road block , we'll ride out in my car '' .
As << I >> slid in beside him he said , `` Some heap , hey ? ?
Five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical two-story house , and when the Jaguar stopped << I >> managed to swallow .
She calmly repeated what Moore had told << me >> .
When << I >> asked , `` Why didn't you go into the living room to see how Mrs. Buck was '' ? ?
The old gal stared at << me >> with her hard eyes , said , `` She didn't call .
<< I >> went up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom -- way I always do in the morning '' .
I went up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom -- way << I >> always do in the morning '' .
<< I >> drummed on the kitchen table with my pencil .
`` << I >> never see none .
But then << I >> wasn't her social secretary '' .
<< I >> walked into the living room .
Look Jed , this is an open and shut case and << I >> have to relieve my men at the road block soon .
<< I >> asked .
<< I >> asked .
<< I >> knew she was lying .
<< I >> stood there , staring at her for a moment -- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty .
Moore said , `` Come on , Jed , << I >> have to get to my men '' .
I'll tell him -- if << I >> see him '' .
<< I >> tried not to act scared .
<< I >> told Moore I was going to eat , get some forms filled out by Doc Abel .
I told Moore << I >> was going to eat , get some forms filled out by Doc Abel .

Chief Moore said , `` If I don't see you when << I >> return , see you for certain at my road block , Inspector '' .
Lighting my pipe , << I >> took a walk .
<< I >> asked an old guy running a fishing station if the boat was Moore's .
<< I >> dropped into the doctor's office , picked up my forms .
<< I >> got into the front seat .
<< I >> drove out of the Harbor , turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees and stopped .
She mumbled , `` << I >> just know that Chief Moore is out to kill my Tim '' ! !
<< I >> never saw him so anxious before '' , I said , lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette .

`` I'd like the room << I >> had the last time '' .
`` Suppose you tell << me >> the real reason '' , he drawled .
Either << I >> get the story -- or I get the suite '' .
Either I get the story -- or << I >> get the suite '' .
In good time << I >> shall get to the distressing actuality , to Red McIver and Handley Walker , to murder and sudden death .
But you realize , << I >> am sure , how much old deeds incite to new ones , and you must forgive me if I tell you first of the old ones .
But you realize , I am sure , how much old deeds incite to new ones , and you must forgive << me >> if I tell you first of the old ones .
But you realize , I am sure , how much old deeds incite to new ones , and you must forgive me if << I >> tell you first of the old ones .
And she answered , `` << I >> don't know , but I hope you'll never do such a thing '' .
And she answered , `` I don't know , but << I >> hope you'll never do such a thing '' .
Much , << I >> assure you .
and << I >> knew they knew it , for I'd told them a lot of it .
You want from << me >> the story , but a story is about ' why ' and then , perhaps , about how .
So what << I >> am trying to tell you is the ' why ' -- that is my point -- and that concerns the spirit of the matter .
There is an inwardness and a luster to old furniture ( look at that mahogany highboy behind you ) which has a provocative emanation , if << I >> may say so .
Today Dogtown is the only deserted village in all New England that << I >> know of .
( << I >> myself have identified about sixty sites , from the old maps and registers .
A fascinating pursuit , << I >> assure you .
) Even << I >> can remember nothing but ruined cellars and tumbled pillars , and nobody has lived there in the memory of any living man .
Both Red McIver and Handley Walker lived nearby , almost as near as << I >> do .
Dead , dead as a brass door nail , and << I >> sometimes feel like the Sexton , for I'm about the last to be even interested .
<< I >> knew Red and Handley well .
And it was because of an old Norberg inheritance that << I >> got to understand them all so well .
The quarrel ended in a ridiculous draw , but << I >> must tell you about it .
You see , besides being custodian of antiquities , << I >> am also registrar .
No , << I >> don't hold with those who live entirely among dead things .
<< I >> know as well as the next man that a ship is called from the rigging she carries , where the live wind blows , and not from the hull .
As << I >> was saying , I've known all about the old records , including the old Norberg deed .
Some ten years ago that page was torn out , << I >> don't know by whom .
About five years ago , Handley came to ask << me >> if he could see the tattered register .
( When you see him , you'll notice his habit of fingering , << I >> might almost say , stroking a large mole with black hairs on it , by his right temple .
A real gentleman , << I >> feel , would do neither .
When << I >> told him someone had torn it out , he shouted .
During the quarrel << I >> learned what the trouble was , from the accusations each hurled at the other .
After the usual Honorable Sirs , it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased Salu Norberg , one lower room , on the Western side , privileges to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar ( << I >> can show you the cellar when we go up ) , also one Cow Right , and lastly they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as dower , namely the Beech Pasture .
And << I >> remember that the whole of the privileges , not counting the Beech Pasture , was valued at twenty pounds .
A disturbing picture of bad blood , to be further heightened with illicit if buccolic colors , for on a subsequent day << I >> saw Handley escorting Anta , Red's wife , up on Dogtown Common .
<< I >> felt it would be inopportune to disclose my presence .
Not that << I >> intentionally go unperceived , but the boulders up there are very high and I am a small woman .
Not that I intentionally go unperceived , but the boulders up there are very high and << I >> am a small woman .
<< I >> suppose Handley knew it .
<< I >> would call them the patterns of life , perhaps even the designs of destiny .
Yet with all this knowledge << I >> had nothing of substance to unravel our case , as you would call it , till yesterday .
<< I >> suppose these absences gave her more clearance for her embraces with Cousin Handley .
Anyhow , << I >> wasn't surprised , early that morning , to see Handley himself crossing from Dogtown Common Road to the Back Road .
<< I >> myself had been up there by seven o'clock , after mushrooms , since there'd been a week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear as Sandwich glass .
`` Guess << I >> can't think of anyone , Pete .
`` << I >> think you aren't taking me seriously , Phil .
`` I think you aren't taking << me >> seriously , Phil .
<< I >> might have got hit by that truck if it wasn't for you .
<< I >> believe in returning favors .
I'll do anything for somebody << I >> like .
Go ahead and try << me >> '' ! !
`` All right '' , he conceded finally , `` if you must know , << I >> don't get along with the landlord .
He keeps riding << me >> because I like to listen to the radio and sing while I'm taking a bath .
He keeps riding me because << I >> like to listen to the radio and sing while I'm taking a bath .
He says the neighbors complain , but << I >> don't believe it .
Why don't they tell << me >> themselves if it bothers them '' ? ?
Give << me >> your address .
You see , << I >> always make it look like an accident .
So you thought << I >> didn't mean what I said .
So you thought I didn't mean what << I >> said .
`` Then she'd get half of everything << I >> have .
Now << I >> see .
You must understand , << I >> haven't been in this state too long .
<< I >> came out here to retire .
You should have told << me >> about her before '' .
After all , << I >> didn't know you , Pete .
<< I >> always work it that way -- and always at a time when the customer has an alibi .
Let << me >> prove it , Phil .
<< I >> went through and down , into pitch darkness .
A moment later he struck a match and lighted a candle , and << I >> could see .
<< I >> looked back over my shoulder while I went to join him ; ;
I looked back over my shoulder while << I >> went to join him ; ;
`` You first '' , << I >> said .
`` Nice place '' , << I >> told him .
`` Listen , << I >> got a buddy I travel with , real nice guy named Larry .
`` Listen , I got a buddy << I >> travel with , real nice guy named Larry .
He hesitated a second , looking at the bottle , before he said `` Sure-sure '' , and << I >> reassured him .
<< I >> took a short swallow from it myself and handed it to him .
`` Perfect set-up '' , << I >> told him .
<< I >> bought another pint of sherry and when we got back Pops let us in in the dark , put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again .
<< I >> introduced my friend Larry to Pops and we made ourselves comfortable .
<< I >> was reminded , amusedly , by a poem of Kenneth Patchen's called The Murder of Two Men by a Young Kid Wearing Lemon Colored Gloves , which Patchen himself read on a record against jazz background .
About halfway through the second bottle , Charlie looked at << me >> across Pops , who was sitting between us and asked `` Now '' ? ?
<< I >> said , `` Wait '' , and handed the bottle to Pops for his final drink .
When he handed it back and << I >> had hold of it safely , Pops was looking toward me and I said `` Now '' , to Charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket , once .

<< I >> reached my hand toward him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat , but Charlie said `` Wait '' ! !
He was holding the piece of lead pipe out to << me >> .
<< I >> gauged that blow to be borderline .
<< I >> dug him , I saw his point ; ;
I dug him , << I >> saw his point ; ;
The thunk was louder , anyway , and << I >> thought I heard bone crack .
The thunk was louder , anyway , and I thought << I >> heard bone crack .
We straightened Pops up and << I >> made sure there was no trace of a heartbeat .
<< I >> nodded to Charlie .
Charlie asked << me >> .
`` Cool '' , << I >> told him .
It was a kick , but not a big enough one for << me >> to want to take the chance again , except for stakes .
`` Take them '' , << I >> said .
Besides , << I >> doubt if the cops will even try dusting .
Almost too smoothly , << I >> found myself thinking , and then told myself that was ridiculous .
Also our plans for << me >> to commit Charlie's murder and for him to commit mine .
I'd tell him everything I'd learned about Seaton's habits and habitat , and he'd tell << me >> the score on Radic .
<< I >> was dead tired and slept soundly , as far as I know dreamlessly .
I was dead tired and slept soundly , as far as << I >> know dreamlessly .
<< I >> drew diagrams and floor plans ; ;
He gave << me >> equivalent and even more detailed dope on Radic , including diagrams -- one of the apartment building Radic lived in and one of the apartment itself .
it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and Charlie said , `` Well , << I >> guess that's it .
`` Wait a minute , Charlie '' , << I >> said .
And if you're as flat broke as << I >> am , I think we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work '' .
And if you're as flat broke as I am , << I >> think we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work '' .
If you draw the short straw I'll lend you some bread , like fifty bucks , before << I >> take off to visit my sister in Frisco .
Then , after I'm back , another fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while << I >> take care of your seat cover boy '' .
`` Solid '' , << I >> said .
You'd have to wait till Seaton's back from Mexico City and also while << I >> set it up with Doris to have her have an alibi for D-night .
He grinned and clapped << me >> on the shoulder .
`` << I >> was hoping you'd say that , Willy .
But << I >> wouldn't have suggested it .
Well -- in that case , << I >> take off tomorrow morning for Frisco .
`` << I >> feel fine ! !
<< I >> have helped him .
<< I >> now grok you are my people -- teach plants another way .
`` At first << I >> was homesick '' , he answered .
`` << I >> was lonely always '' .
`` But now << I >> am not lonely .
<< I >> grok I shall never be lonely again '' .
I grok << I >> shall never be lonely again '' .
Is that -- << I >> mean , ' Do you know ' '' --
`` << I >> know .
A colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs of plants and Mrs. Joseph ( `` Shadow of Greatness '' ) Douglas was quoted as saying : `` << I >> would no more sit down without flowers on my table than without serviettes '' .
You too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned << me >> .
`` << I >> held still for the same thing , didn't I ? ?
`` I held still for the same thing , didn't << I >> ? ?
I'm helping you now , am << I >> not ? ?
Where do << I >> start '' ? ?
that is all << I >> can tell you about them .
`` Forgive << me >> , Sandalphon '' , said Hal .
<< I >> believe it was on page 573 '' ! !
Macneff smiled and said , `` << I >> am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression '' .
<< I >> still bear scars on my back where Pornsen , my gapt , whipped me because I had not learned my lessons well enough .

`` Please pardon << me >> again , Sandalphon '' , said Hal .
<< I >> can't tell you now the distance in lightyears or what star this was , though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere .
`` But << I >> have just thought of one thing .
`` Tell << me >> more , Sandalphon '' .
`` << I >> had no idea that you , too , would be on this glorious voyage .
But << I >> might have known ! !
`` For instance , Hesperus agreed to help << me >> find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth .
`` For instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and << I >> agreed to take him to Earth .
`` I'm going to turn my generator back on , as << I >> promised to do .
But << I >> can't take you to Earth yet .
`` Nobody else can live in your hearth while << I >> am in it '' , Hesperus said promptly .
If because of this incident they become angry with Earth , << I >> will not be permitted to go there at all .
Therefore of course << I >> will help '' .
`` Nothing wrong with << me >> that couldn't be cured '' , Nogol said .
`` << I >> think they're dead '' , Ekstrohm interjected quietly .
`` Ekstrohm , you and << I >> will have a look '' , Ryan said .
`` << I >> heard a story once about a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't get an encephalographic reading on him .
Me , << I >> know the mind of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner '' .
It sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species to << me >> .
`` << I >> don't know about that .
But there's one possibility << I >> particularly don't like '' .
<< I >> just hope it doesn't work on Earthmen too .
What do you think << I >> did with them '' ? ?
`` << I >> don't know .
All << I >> know is that they are gone '' .
`` Why pick << me >> for your patsy ? ?
`` Listen , Ekstrohm , << I >> want to give you the benefit of every doubt .
`` You've been hiding things from << me >> and Nogol every jump we've made with you .
`` What could << I >> do with your lousy dead bodies ? ?
`` All << I >> know is that you were outside the bubbles last night , and you were the only sentient being who came in or out of our alarm web .
<< I >> give you my word I'm not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke , or to deliberately foul up the expedition .
`` << I >> don't think I can .
`` I don't think << I >> can .
<< I >> outweigh you fifty pounds and I'm fast for a big man '' .
`` << I >> wasn't planning on jumping you .
Why do you have to jump << me >> the first time something goes wrong ? ?
<< I >> enjoyed my lessons '' .
`` << I >> meant that you have a nice singing voice dear '' , the lady amended .
`` << I >> am currently reproducing the Last Supper on the head of a screw '' .
`` No , << I >> say '' , the lady twittered .
`` Of course , some of my color values do not match the old Master's and the perspective is faulty but << I >> believe it to be a fair copy '' .
`` Oh , << I >> forget '' , and Helva's voice was really contrite .
`` << I >> had that in mind '' .
Do you have anything for << me >> '' ? ?
Mercer stammered , not knowing what B'dikkat meant , and the two-nosed man answered for him , `` << I >> think he has a nice baby head , but it isn't big enough for you to take yet '' .
Maybe << I >> will grow another head .
<< I >> can talk .
<< I >> do so believe in death '' ! !
`` << I >> never saw that '' , said Mercer , `` but I '' --
`` I never saw that '' , said Mercer , `` but << I >> '' --
`` But you want to ask << me >> when B'dikkat is going to come back with the needle '' .

`` << I >> saw your fire '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger .
And << I >> appreciate the advice '' .
It's bigger than it has to be , though << I >> don't see where it's doing any harm .
Why should << I >> ? ?
`` << I >> know him .
<< I >> ought to .
He sold << me >> a clear title .
`` It wouldn't matter to my father , and not to << me >> .
<< I >> meant what I said about that fire .

Such was my state of mind that << I >> did not question the possibility of this ; ;
under the circumstances << I >> was only too willing to confess all .
<< I >> was nearly thirty at the time .
<< I >> went to the hall in the afternoons only , on these preliminary matters .
Sometimes << I >> was aware of people moving about in the darkness .
<< I >> would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but I never quite succeeded .

He spoke to << me >> in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality .
<< I >> felt certain he was really a spineless little man .
) hung on a hook on the wall , and underneath it << I >> could see his tie , knotted , ready to be slipped over his head , a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck .
Once , pressing him , << I >> learned that his job was only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall .
With distaste << I >> saw him assume a pompous air .
What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon << me >> .
In the mornings , << I >> was informed , fluorescent tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall .
He pointed out the switch to << me >> and for a moment I foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words .

Having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed , << I >> gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself .
One afternoon , upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk , << I >> had visited the toilet adjoining the hall .
By counting the number of stalls and urinals << I >> attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time .
For although << I >> had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet I still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended .
For although I had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet << I >> still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended .
<< I >> could observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I had no measure of comparison .

I knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall , but what they were doing , and exactly where , << I >> could not tell .
It was , << I >> felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light .
This light did not penetrate very far back into the hall , and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when << I >> tried to pick out whatever might be lying , or squatting , on the floor below .
And << I >> had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place , like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office , flicked off and on impatiently .
This sort of petty vigilance annoyed << me >> .
<< I >> felt certain it was self-appointed .
<< I >> felt strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance .

Though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town , its character was wholly foreign to << me >> .
The river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented << me >> from seeing it .
Sometimes << I >> noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs .
<< I >> kept circling the block hoping to see , from the street behind it , the rear of the hall .
For weeks << I >> wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages , truck terminals and taxi repair shops , gasoline pumps and longshoremen's lunch counters , yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there .

<< I >> returned to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk .
As << I >> had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application .
When << I >> asked him what , if anything , I could do about it , he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall .

When I went for my interview with the director << I >> saw why .
<< I >> had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs .
No one was behind it , but in the rear wall of the office << I >> noticed , for the first time , a door which had been left partially open .
Past it << I >> could see part part of a desk , a flag in a corner , a rug on the floor .
<< I >> rapped my knuckles on the counter .
<< I >> was at once disappointed , although just what I had expected him to look like I could not have explained .

But he came toward me sedately enough , showed me around the counter , offered << me >> a seat inside his office , then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application .
<< I >> had the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times .
As he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk << I >> wondered what this dapper , slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall .
Why had << I >> registered ? ?
indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college graduate himself , must envy << me >> them .
What sort of men << I >> would come into contact with , at the hall ? ?
These questions did not surprise << me >> ; ;
<< I >> felt certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom moved beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , was a jungle , a dark and unwelcome place .
Though << I >> doubted that he would understand me , I told the director my motives for applying .

He dumped << me >> in solitary twice '' .
`` Let's get one thing straight , you and << me >> .
`` << I >> won't even try to thank you '' .
He said in a studied voice , `` << I >> didn't do it for you .
<< I >> did it for the valley .
We've been starving and << I >> don't like to starve '' .
`` Meaning you want << me >> to ride out '' ? ?
`` << I >> got no place to go '' .
But Kruger's men keep them off balance , and they don't trust << me >> .
`` << I >> was afraid of this .
<< I >> almost didn't tell you '' .
<< I >> understand how you feel about the child .
`` << I >> never saw him .

`` << I >> want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord .
`` To << me >> you'll always be the girl o' my dreams , an' the sweetest flower that grows '' .

<< I >> think you're mean and hateful and stupid , and -- louder '' ? ?
So << I >> can hear you while I'm checkin' the car .

If << I >> could make myself feel the same way

`` What else would << I >> mean , anyways '' ? ?

Finally Hernandez said , `` << I >> could offer you advice , Tomas , but you wouldn't heed it '' .
How long should << I >> wait '' ? ?
`` In a year she'll like living in Clayton's house too much to come back to << me >> '' , Brannon said flatly .
I've got to take Danny away from Clayton before << I >> lose him altogether .
Hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forgotten << me >> -- his own father '' ! !
`` In my place , you'd follow such advice as you give << me >> '' ? ?

`` Brannon , << I >> warn you '' ! !
<< I >> won't '' --
`` Just let << me >> meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face '' ! !
`` That's all << I >> ask '' ! !
`` Exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business proposition with << me >> '' , he'd blandly announce .
`` And << I >> sort o' got a corner on the market '' .
`` Yeah , << I >> can see that '' , the friend was forced to agree .
`` << I >> seen a lot o' things in my time .
<< I >> found a trooper once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill , and another time we ran across some teamsters they'd caught , tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o' their skulls .

I'm sure you won't mind doing << me >> a small favor '' .
`` What is it you want << me >> to do , Mr. Brenner '' ? ?
<< I >> just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari .
`` << I >> don't know , Mr. Brenner '' , he said haltingly , beginning to get an inkling of Brenner's plans .
Couldn't << I >> just '' -- His voice trailed off into silence .
`` You and << I >> have a little talking to do , Jess .
If << I >> don't come back in the house , Breed's going to '' --
Now turn around so << I >> can see your face '' .
<< I >> suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four , either ; ;
`` << I >> heard how you outdrew Chico .
<< I >> ain't a gunslinger '' .
`` Tell << me >> about Arbuckle ! !
`` Soon as we send them on their way and make camp , let's you and << me >> go for a walk down by the Snake -- all by ourselves '' .
`` Got a lot to tend to , but I'll get back quick as << I >> can '' , he assured her .
`` << I >> know you ain't '' ! !
`` Me and you's trading hats so's you'll have something permanent to remember << me >> by '' ! !
<< I >> can see Dan .
`` Not that it matters to << me >> , being this far along '' .
At these words of sympathy and understanding , Harmony said generously , `` << I >> don't mind setting here along with Gran while you go out and join in the games '' .
`` Don't reckon there's nobody out there , 'cept maybe Dan , who can outgrip << me >> , Harmony '' .
`` A body would swear << I >> floated right up here on a cloud '' ! !
`` << I >> ain't ragging him '' ! !
`` But the sun'll fry it out'n << me >> onct we git to rolling '' .
`` From now on , Sally and << me >> and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and Rod's outfit '' .

`` But << I >> still think Penny's an awful nice girl , Russ '' --
`` You don't have to tell << me >> '' , flashed Cobb .
`` Penny's always glad to see << me >> over there '' , he mused bleakly .
`` I've got her as neat as << I >> can '' , Donovan said , as he dropped the straps of the Seton harness over Greg's shoulders .
`` Moriarty '' , my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite , so final in his tone << I >> once more repeated the absurdity , mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced .
Adios '' , << I >> said , exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters .
<< I >> waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass .
Then << I >> saw the father's head slightly turn ; ;
Suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled , and , thumbing hopefully , << I >> saw emergent in windshield flash : red lips , streaming silk of blonde hair and -- ah , trembling confusion of hope , apprehension , despair -- the leering face of old Herry .
<< I >> would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and -- Well , at least I wouldn't have shouted back a taunt .

`` No , << I >> don't '' , Johnson said .
How lightly her `` eventshah-leh '' passed into the crannies where << I >> was storing dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus , and how the word would echo .
`` In back , buddy '' , the driver said to << me >> .
Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack , << I >> stepped on the running board ; ;
<< I >> seized the rack and made a western-style flying-mount just in time , one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag -- and merely wrecking my camera , I was to discover later -- my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and -- but this is no medical report .

<< I >> was again in motion and at a speed which belied the truck's similarity to Senor X's Ford turtle .
Maybe << I >> would beat old Herry to Siberia after all .
<< I >> drew back , drawing back my foot for a kick .
The way his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth << I >> thought he was only having a little joke , but , no , he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear .

`` Hell , yes '' , << I >> roared back between dusty lips .
Did << I >> want a beer ? ?
At once my ears were drowned by a flow of what << I >> took to be Spanish , but -- the driver's white teeth flashing at me , the road wildly veering beyond his glistening hair , beyond his gesticulating bottle -- it could have been the purest Oxford English I was half hearing ; ;

<< I >> ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards .
When << I >> fell on my back , I saw a vulture hovering .
When I fell on my back , << I >> saw a vulture hovering .
<< I >> regained my squatting position behind the truck cab's rear window .
`` That was Tee-wah << I >> was talking .
You thought << I >> was a Mexican , didn't you , buddy '' ? ?
<< I >> nodded .
`` Hell , that's all right , buddy '' , the Indian ( << I >> now guessed ) said .
No sooner had << I >> started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck .
<< I >> drank furiously .
Teeth again flashing back at << me >> , the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which `` amigo '' appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound .
<< I >> bobbed my head each time it appeared .
<< I >> tossed the bottle .
But Johnson couldn't quickly unwire the truck door , and if << I >> escaped , he might suffer .
with more time << I >> could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin --
Suddenly and not a second too soon << I >> thought of the coins in my pocket .
<< I >> got a coin between my thumb and forefinger , leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile .
<< I >> heard the screech of brakes behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath me .
I heard the screech of brakes behind << me >> , an insane burst of laughter beneath me .
I heard the screech of brakes behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath << me >> .
Looking back << I >> saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number .
<< I >> saw Johnson's bottle snatched from his hand , saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car .
<< I >> looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the car's rear window .
<< I >> quickly turned around and began to drink .
She sat quietly , staring at << me >> from the wide eyes .
It was a disturbingly familiar face , too , but << I >> couldn't remember where we had met .
<< I >> said , `` Do we know each other , Miss '' ? ?
`` No , << I >> remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here , and when it happened all I could think of was '' -- This time she stopped the rush of words herself .
`` No , I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here , and when it happened all << I >> could think of was '' -- This time she stopped the rush of words herself .

There had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out , and now << I >> was certain I'd seen her somewhere before .
`` << I >> forgot '' ! !
`` Oh , do forgive << me >> .
`` << I >> forgive '' --
`` You and << me >> both , dear .
Haven't we haven't << I >> seen you .
<< I >> mean , surely we've '' --
`` You may have seen << me >> on TV '' , she said .
Then it hit << me >> .
<< I >> cried .
In fact , << I >> was watching you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell .
<< I >> sat by her on the divan .
It was fun for << me >> , all right .
<< I >> don't mean to pry , but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles ? ?
<< I >> mean : Is advertising honest ? ?
<< I >> never wear anything at all .
`` << I >> couldn't agree with you more '' .
`` << I >> really do have something important to tell you , Mr. Scott .
Oh , yeah '' , << I >> said .
`` Tell << me >> about the murder '' .
She told << me >> .
The finished -- and drastically cut -- product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering the suds , then bursting above the pool's surface clad in layers of lavender lather , and << I >> had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap ; ;
Joyce went on , `` When we'd finished , Lou -- Mr. Thor -- asked << me >> to stay a little longer .
Did , << I >> mean '' .
`` << I >> didn't know .
<< I >> wouldn't have the stuff in the house .
`` So << I >> just scooted out of his clutches .
The keys were still in it , and << I >> was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where I'd changed '' .
The keys were still in it , and I was miles away before << I >> remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where I'd changed '' .

I was so scared well , << I >> just ran to my car and came here '' .
`` No , << I >> never did see his face .

I didn't get a good look at him at all , his back was to me , and << I >> was so scared It was just somebody in a man's suit .
What Joyce wanted << me >> to do was go to Thor's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes -- and handbag containing her identification .
`` And << I >> so want the part '' , she said .
<< I >> could show what I can do '' .
I could show what << I >> can do '' .
As far as << I >> was concerned , she had already and had dandily shown what she could do .
But << I >> promised Joyce I would mention her name , if at all , only as a last resort .
But I promised Joyce << I >> would mention her name , if at all , only as a last resort .
Seeming much relieved , she smiled one of those worth-waiting-for smiles , and << I >> smiled all the way into the bedroom .
<< I >> showed her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` If you really don't mind , I think I'll get clean in the shower , then soak for a few minutes in your tub .
I showed her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` If you really don't mind , << I >> think I'll get clean in the shower , then soak for a few minutes in your tub .
`` Only when << I >> do it '' .
<< I >> shook my head .
It'll probably be at least an hour or two before << I >> can check back with you .
<< I >> looked at my watch .
`` Well , goodbye '' , << I >> said .
However , when there's a job to be done , I'm a monstrosity of grim determination , << I >> like to think .
<< I >> spun about and clattered through the front room to the door .
As << I >> went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower .

Bryn Mawr Drive is only two or three miles from the Spartan , and it took << me >> less than five minutes to get there .
<< I >> followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool .
Two uniformed officers , a couple of plain-clothesmen << I >> knew , and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left .
Lieutenant Rawlins , one of the plain-clothesmen , spotted << me >> and said , `` Hi , Shell '' , and walked toward me .

Neither of them , << I >> understood , had been present at the filming session earlier .

<< I >> said , `` O.K. , so now only Blake knows .
<< I >> worked for my Uncle ( an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest ) who ran one of those antique shops in New Orleans' Vieux Carre , the old French Quarter .
The arrangement << I >> had with him was to work four hours a day .
The rest of the time << I >> devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting .

My Uncle and << I >> were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages .
One Monday morning << I >> saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt .
One Monday morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce << me >> to her as my new Aunt .
There was something about the contour of her face , her smile that was like New Orleans sunshine , the way she held her head , the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate << me >> .
You must forgive << me >> if I seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but I am an artist , accustomed to studying the physical body .

And that is the way << I >> first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store .
That she impressed << me >> instantly was obvious ; ;
<< I >> was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them .
True , she was my Aunt , married to an Uncle related to << me >> only by marriage , but why she had married a man twice her age , and more , perhaps , I did not know or much care .

I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told << me >> of my Uncle's indisposition .
Even as she was telling << me >> about it I became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks , and subconsciously I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights .

It did not take << me >> long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch .

`` << I >> don't understand '' , she insisted .
`` No '' , << I >> chuckled , `` I'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education '' .

<< I >> heard subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French Quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date .
Shortly before nine << I >> drove my jalopy to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view .

In the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed , the lights go on : `` In dull domestic radiance << I >> watch her staring face , still blind , Start wincing in obedience To dirty waters , counters , pots and pans , Waiting below stairs , in her mind '' .

Brassnose , Max and << I >> leaped into the sea and swam to the boat .
The big man with the whitened hair murmured something : his words sounded as if they were in the Manu tongue , which << I >> recognized , having studied the dialect in my Anthropology 6 , class at the University of Chicago .

<< I >> saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there .
<< I >> looked with revulsion at the legs .
`` You have every right to be '' , << I >> replied gravely in the Manu dialect , but my attention was fixed on Brassnose , the biggest and strongest of us .
<< I >> felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these girls that we were afraid .
<< I >> clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the maku Frayne .

`` << I >> have no card '' , she said bitterly .

My mother wanted to call << me >> Sylphide , but it sounded too affected '' .
Spencer was quiet for a moment longer , then he said , `` There is nothing << I >> want to say , Captain '' .
`` More arrests , << I >> fear '' .
<< I >> saw him myself and it was done after consultation with Cromwell .
<< I >> swear it , sir '' .
`` Of course , << I >> agree with the Captain '' , Gansevoort said thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy is ferocious and desperate .
He said , `` Captain , may << I >> speak , please ? ?
Captain , << I >> am innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' .

`` << I >> cannot speak for others , sir , but I am innocent '' .

Rachel steered << me >> along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the Torah .
<< I >> was suddenly conscious of my bare arms .
<< I >> turned and watched him stride down the center of the road .
Rachel had seen << me >> watching the young man .
<< I >> swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside Rachel .
She led << me >> into a twisting side alley .
He nodded , clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch , and flicked glances at << me >> .
Since they did not glance curiously at us once , << I >> guessed that there was a penalty for distraction .
<< I >> stared at him for a long time .
<< I >> could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair .
<< I >> shuddered and backed out of the room .
Rachel followed , looked at << me >> , and clucked with her tongue .
<< I >> said , `` How long do they keep that up '' ? ?
<< I >> rubbed my hands together .
Then << I >> picked it up again and handed it to the old man .
He thanked << me >> .
<< I >> didn't look at him .
<< I >> grinned at Rachel .
<< I >> said .
<< I >> was amazed .
And << I >> wasn't .
<< I >> resented them .
Rachel faced << me >> .
She said , `` Sometimes << I >> think they are keeping religion for us while we play around .
<< I >> said quietly , respectfully , `` What did she do here ? ?
It was an impulse when she was here in Me'a She'arim -- << I >> was with her -- that led her to stay in Israel .
<< I >> said quietly , gaining nerve , ready to ask any question at all , no matter how intimate , ready to be rebuffed , `` Then why did she leave Israel ? ?
She pursed her lips , then clamped them together so tightly that << I >> thought she was angry with me .

Then his son did something '' -- Rachel threw up her hands -- `` << I >> don't know what , but something , to an official here -- it was during the Mandate -- and the son was imprisoned .
Then she continued with energy , `` << I >> myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father .

Rachel gave << me >> a direct , bright-eyed look .

`` And I'll take you with << me >> '' .
`` What did << I >> imagine '' ? ?
`` Did << I >> see him about to swing low in a chariot ? ?

You think : `` Did he feel that way about << me >> '' ? ?
`` << I >> should have stayed at the store '' , she thought .
<< I >> did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints : naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , daring the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver .

the book was a fine historical novel about Edward 3 , , and << I >> did a week of research to get the details just right : the fifteenth-century armor , furnishings , clothes .
<< I >> even ferreted out the materials from which shields were made -- linden wood covered with leather -- so I'd get the light reflections accurate .
<< I >> said , `` Mr. McKenzie , it is as authentic as careful research can make it '' .
In the end , << I >> did the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only I put a Lord Byron shirt on the guy , gave him a sword instead of a pistol , and painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie .

<< I >> wanted to paint again .
<< I >> hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year .
It wasn't just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse << I >> often used , even to myself .

I had admired him long before << I >> talked to him .
It looked to << me >> as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income .
He was fifteen years older than << I >> -- forty-four -- but full of spring and sparkle .
He didn't look like what << I >> thought of as an old man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger .
<< I >> had a long talk with him .
<< I >> asked .
`` << I >> don't think I've reached the point , yet , where I can say I know everything I ought to know about the craft .

`` I'm also studying enameling with Hajime Iijima '' , he went on , `` and twice a week << I >> go to a life class taught by Pendleton '' .

`` Yes , it sounds great '' , << I >> said , `` but suppose you don't think of yourself as an impressionist painter '' ? ?
The upshot of the evening was that << I >> got the address of Pendleton's studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he didn't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning .
It was an awkward hour , but << I >> didn't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job .

After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with << me >> so they wouldn't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to work .
<< I >> don't know that it was always as rewarding as I had expected it to be .
I don't know that it was always as rewarding as << I >> had expected it to be .
Partly , it was because Pendleton himself wasn't what << I >> anticipated .

`` << I >> can't find it in the glove compartment '' .
`` Via must have it '' , << I >> answered readily enough , recalling her last visit .

She looked as if she were accusing << me >> of some fraud .
Walter was giving << me >> checks for my pay , the household bills .
<< I >> don't even own the house I'm standing in .
<< I >> was so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace , and then the lawyer would tear up all those things

So << I >> went about my business .
<< I >> made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend .
At last , << I >> thought , she's recovering her spirits .

In the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village << I >> crept along with my headlights full on .
<< I >> did notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the woods but as I had left a light on in my own house because of the fog I assumed Mrs. Salter had done the same before she left for town .

Everything was as << I >> had left it the night before last -- her portfolio and bag for town , her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out only her mink coat was missing .
<< I >> , who until that day before had been Mrs. Salter's friend , her equal , was the servant now .
And when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to << me >> .
And after << I >> brought them sandwiches and coffee I had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait .

Everyone stared at << me >> and drew back .
Was that what had given way in << me >> ? ?
Even now << I >> am appalled at how little anyone knows of what they really are .
It is absurd of course to say that that one exclamation estranged << me >> from the family I considered my very own , but there it hangs , a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other .

No , << I >> forget Mrs. Mathias , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened .
`` We all feel guilty '' , << I >> turned away from her coldly .
<< I >> added .
It was coarse , almost insulting , this harsh appraisal , and she has never come to see << me >> since .
If they say << I >> could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of self-examination , her search into herself and its conclusions .
Yes , << I >> had cried out that I knew she'd do it , but without my fully realizing it at the time , it was a cry of triumph for her , praise at her deliverance from pettiness and greed -- and guilt .

Then Via called to say they had decided to cremate her -- as they had Ellen , the thought leaped to my mind -- and did << I >> want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning .
<< I >> knelt , just for decency I thought at the time , but found myself whispering , `` Our Father which Art in Heaven '' And it was only after that that something unlocked in me and I felt a grief .

`` << I >> guess so '' , she said taking a Kleenex from her purse .
`` Don't you know all about << me >> by this time ? ?

`` Maybe << I >> could '' , he said , surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him .
`` And << I >> don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit '' , she said , making a face .
`` << I >> don't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention .
`` << I >> think I'll sleep in this morning '' , she said drowsily , and as she snuggled against him , he wondered if she ever went to church .
`` Since we're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` << I >> think I'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' .
And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , << I >> can do it , Sam .
`` << I >> am what I am .
`` I am what << I >> am .
<< I >> can't help it '' .
Agnese , smiling too , said , `` 'ello '' , and then more slowly , `` << I >> am happy '' .
It's like a flame , << I >> guess '' , she said in a dreamy tone .
`` << I >> shall call your father ! !
Go back where you can bring no harm , or << I >> will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame '' ! !
But now with real anger at last , something proud and indignant , Early Spring stood like a she wolf before her den and cried , `` << I >> will not shriek at you ! !

On the defensive , he added , `` << I >> wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without Greg , to be a new widow , a young widow '' .

`` << I >> can't make it in ten minutes '' -- Wondering , as I said it , why I should make it at all .
`` I can't make it in ten minutes '' -- Wondering , as << I >> said it , why I should make it at all .
`` I can't make it in ten minutes '' -- Wondering , as I said it , why << I >> should make it at all .
Why should << I >> go over at midnight to check on Francie , when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party ? ?
`` All right '' , << I >> said .
Not for the dollar or so Nadine would give << me >> .
Chris was sound asleep , and << I >> didn't see any sense in waking him .
<< I >> dressed in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened .
<< I >> drove off through the cool darkness to Nadine's apartment and rang the bell , and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door .
<< I >> just came over to make sure everything was all right '' .
`` << I >> have to get up early for church tomorrow '' , she went on .
`` << I >> didn't know it was going to be this late '' ! !
`` That's Mrs. Roberts again '' , << I >> said .
<< I >> crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone .
<< I >> told Nadine everything was fine , and that I'd be getting on home .
She didn't even give << me >> a chance to refuse .
But then << I >> looked at Shirley and thought that I might as well -- the child needed her sleep , and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with Wally coming home drunk .
But then I looked at Shirley and thought that << I >> might as well -- the child needed her sleep , and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with Wally coming home drunk .
So << I >> told her Mrs. Roberts would pay her in the morning , and she scooted off to her own apartment .
After << I >> looked in at Francie , I went into the living room and waited .
After I looked in at Francie , << I >> went into the living room and waited .
<< I >> must have dozed off , because I came to with a start at the sound of voices .
I must have dozed off , because << I >> came to with a start at the sound of voices .
<< I >> opened the door , and Wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if Nadine had pushed him .
<< I >> had always thought she was so beautiful .
`` You stay out of this '' , she spat at << me >> .
`` He's ruined us -- do you hear << me >> -- he's ruined us ! !
We're ruined and he's going to get out if << I >> have to throw him down the stairs '' --
`` you'd better simmer down '' , << I >> said nervously .
<< I >> was plenty scared .
<< I >> clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth .
She collapsed against << me >> , as if everything inside her snapped .
<< I >> got her into bed , and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out .
It was three o'clock before << I >> figured it was all right to go .
<< I >> had done all I could .
I had done all << I >> could .
<< I >> had done all I was going to do .
I had done all << I >> was going to do .
<< I >> snuggled up close to him -- loving him -- thankful for a man like him .
Thankful << I >> wasn't Nadine .
<< I >> kept on being thankful .
`` I'd had all this trouble with the old man , that's why << I >> drank so much .
<< I >> -- got fired yesterday for not attending to business '' --
`` << I >> thought I'd smooth things over through Ken '' , Wally said miserably .
And << I >> was plastered and I blew my stack '' --
And I was plastered and << I >> blew my stack '' --
But << I >> couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved .
Little by little , during the week , Chris and << I >> discovered the crazy unbelievable way Nadine and Wally had lived .
`` << I >> wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over '' .
<< I >> said I wished we were , too .
I said << I >> wished we were , too .
Something << I >> had simply never thought of .
<< I >> just stared at him .
It was incredible -- He gave << me >> an embarrassed , pleading look .
`` << I >> know we'd be pretty crowded .
`` << I >> won't do it '' , I said flatly .
`` I won't do it '' , << I >> said flatly .
Well , now she can sleep in the street for all << I >> care '' ! !
<< I >> didn't want to be like that , mean and bitter .
While << I >> worked , Nadine sat and cried .
<< I >> figured I could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks .
I figured << I >> could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks .
<< I >> mentioned it to Chris one stifling hot night , when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air .
I mentioned it to Chris one stifling hot night , when << I >> had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air .
<< I >> don't really believe in intuition .
But << I >> swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes , I knew it was going to be a bad day .
But I swear to you from the moment << I >> opened my eyes , I knew it was going to be a bad day .
But I swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes , << I >> knew it was going to be a bad day .
Part of it was the weather , so foggy it would take << me >> twice as long to get to the hospital .
For the thousandth time , << I >> wished I'd chosen some nice , nine-to-five , five-days-a-week profession .
And for the thousandth time , << I >> answered myself .
Actually , << I >> shouldn't complain , I told myself in the shaving mirror .
Actually , I shouldn't complain , << I >> told myself in the shaving mirror .
<< I >> had a lot to be thankful for .
A profession that brought << me >> as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at .
Maybe << I >> didn't see as much of Gladdy as I'd like , but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went -- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home .
<< I >> was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it .
But << I >> mustn't start on Alice .
As usual , Gladdy's bright smile greeted << me >> at the breakfast table .
Her first class wasn't until ten , but she always got up to have breakfast with << me >> .
It made << me >> feel good and knowing that she'd decided , all on her own , to go to college right here in town made me feel good , too .
It made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided , all on her own , to go to college right here in town made << me >> feel good , too .
<< I >> had a feeling that young Pete Michelson , the most promising intern at Fairview , had something to do with it , too .
But once << I >> was alone again , driving to the hospital , the heaviness returned .
The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when << I >> got to Fairview .
I'm Chief of Medicine here and this morning would start like all others , with << me >> taking the boys on the rounds .
When we'd finished our regular rounds , Pete pointed << me >> toward the small ward at the end of the floor .
`` << I >> haven't seen her yet , but I hear she's a lulu '' ! !
`` I haven't seen her yet , but << I >> hear she's a lulu '' ! !
<< I >> wasn't surprised .
The moment << I >> walked in , the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed .
But there was something about her -- and << I >> felt my lips forming a name .
She looked about sixty , though << I >> recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four .
No , no it was an unfortunate resemblance , that was all it was , and << I >> turned to Dick , forcing myself to put my disquiet out of my mind .
Turning toward the patient again , << I >> -- I can't describe what happened to me then , except to say that I felt sick .
Turning toward the patient again , I -- << I >> can't describe what happened to me then , except to say that I felt sick .

I tell you , it took every ounce of control << I >> had to be able to speak .
<< I >> never liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it relaxes them , I've always thought , to chat first .
It was then that << I >> saw what the drawn-back covers revealed .
<< I >> asked .
`` << I >> been spotting a little now and then '' , she said quietly , no emotion in her voice .
`` Better do a Papanicolaou '' , << I >> told Pete .
It was only a few moments before Miss Groggins had her in the proper position for a vaginal , but << I >> couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination .
That done , << I >> told Miss Groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind .
Late in the afternoon , << I >> was up on Seven again .
One of my private patients was being admitted and << I >> went in to see her settled .
On my way to the elevator , << I >> ran into Pete .
`` Well '' -- << I >> didn't -- I didn't ever want to see that woman again .
`` Well '' -- I didn't -- << I >> didn't ever want to see that woman again .
`` Groggins tells << me >> she's started badgering already , wants to get out .
<< I >> grimaced in distaste .
`` Well , better see what << I >> can do '' .
We'd been standing right outside Miss Bancroft's door and as << I >> went to turn the knob to enter , I was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar .
We'd been standing right outside Miss Bancroft's door and as I went to turn the knob to enter , << I >> was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar .
`` << I >> sure can't complain about the service in this place '' , she said .
`` << I >> just got through seeing one of you guys .
There was something almost insulting in her tone , but << I >> disregarded it .
`` Suppose you let << me >> explain .
Actually , << I >> rather doubt that we'll have to do this .
<< I >> was sure that was the difficulty -- she just didn't want to stay here , where she couldn't get to the liquor .
<< I >> looked at her in amazement .
`` Will you tell << me >> why '' ? ?
`` I've got cancer , haven't << I >> '' ? ?
Just let << me >> die in peace '' .
<< I >> stared at her , almost speechless .
Her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person << I >> thought she was .
This was someone who'd come down in the world , << I >> thought .
`` You haven't got cancer '' , << I >> said as strongly as I could .
`` You haven't got cancer '' , I said as strongly as << I >> could .
`` Don't give << me >> a lot of talk , Joe '' .
<< I >> gaped at her .
She was watching << me >> intently , a funny little half-smile on her lips .
Guess I've changed , haven't << I >> ? ?
`` Alice '' -- << I >> stammered through dry lips .
`` What's the matter , Joe , you scared of << me >> ? ?
Just let << me >> outta here '' --
As for coming back here -- well , I'll tell you the truth , << I >> didn't even know where I was when I came to .
As for coming back here -- well , I'll tell you the truth , I didn't even know where << I >> was when I came to .
As for coming back here -- well , I'll tell you the truth , I didn't even know where I was when << I >> came to .
The last thing << I >> remember is a bar in San Diego '' --
`` << I >> never asked you for any favors , Joe '' , she went on , `` but I'm asking one now .
Let << me >> outta here ! !
<< I >> looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me .
I looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before << me >> .
What she'd said was true -- in all these years , she'd never asked for anything from << me >> .
If << I >> let her go , she'd disappear once more .
<< I >> was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea .
She made << me >> welcome .
the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not << me >> but the air I breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic .
the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air << I >> breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic .

The metal-tasting nitrogen made << me >> wonder if I should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water .

It was when << I >> packed up what duds I had and went to Paris .
It was when I packed up what duds << I >> had and went to Paris .
It was no vacation , just << me >> getting out after a bellyfull .
Wild kicks never are , but << I >> hoped to dig up a better frame of mind .
Once before << I >> had been to Paris , long before I married Valery .
Once before I had been to Paris , long before << I >> married Valery .
That first time was good and it stuck with << me >> .
<< I >> was twenty-one back then , in the army , and fog put our plane down at Orly instead of Rhine-Main .
<< I >> had a pocketful of money , which was unusual when I was in the army , and the plane would be grounded all night .
I had a pocketful of money , which was unusual when << I >> was in the army , and the plane would be grounded all night .
In less than an hour << I >> had gotten a hotel , showered , shaved and was out on the Champs Elysees in a fresh uniform .
<< I >> felt like a Hun in Rome .
There was the Arc de Triomphe and the Tour d'Eiffel -- << I >> was no yokel , but I was young , and this was Paris ! !
There was the Arc de Triomphe and the Tour d'Eiffel -- I was no yokel , but << I >> was young , and this was Paris ! !
<< I >> had champagne at Maxim's , then went into a cafe called the Jour et Nuit to ask the way to Montmartre .
<< I >> never got there .
<< I >> stared .
<< I >> didn't know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful .
`` Handsome soldier , << I >> have assuaged one hunger with food .
<< I >> feel another of terrible urgency .
Toward the break of day << I >> waxed philosophical , and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese .
Now it was nine years later , and it wasn't spring but winter when << I >> returned .
<< I >> made the mistake of going to the Jour et Nuit .
The place was busy but << I >> didn't feel like a Hun .
<< I >> sat waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up .

<< I >> had part of a bottle of French beer called Panther Pils ( so help me ) , then switched to Tuborg .
I had part of a bottle of French beer called Panther Pils ( so help << me >> ) , then switched to Tuborg .
<< I >> went to my hotel and slept .
The next morning a little cognac made << me >> feel better -- but what can you do in Paris on Sunday morning ? ?
So << I >> drank more cognac .
All that day and Monday << I >> drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space .
<< I >> was turning over the idea of a good debauchery when I dozed off .

<< I >> went out into it .

<< I >> was just miserable .
She saw << me >> and sat down beside me , three feet away .
She saw me and sat down beside << me >> , three feet away .
It gave her the right to sit down beside << me >> , back straight , one hand out on the handle .
<< I >> knew all about her .
<< I >> didn't much care if she were there or not .
Hardly glancing at her , << I >> smiled a bleak one which said , Thanks , baby , but I'd rather be alone .
`` I'm not unhappy '' , << I >> lied , staring at the snow .
`` Well -- women and unhappiness go together '' , << I >> observed profoundly , adding , `` You can wager your derriere on that '' .
This took << me >> so funny I had to look at her .
This took me so funny << I >> had to look at her .
<< I >> felt my frozen sad face crumble , and I grinned a silly one I couldn't have helped .
I felt my frozen sad face crumble , and << I >> grinned a silly one I couldn't have helped .

<< I >> even snorted a chuckle .
She was even more miserable than << me >> .
<< I >> could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes , and I wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit .
I could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes , and << I >> wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit .
Anyway , << I >> pulled a bottle of Remy Martin out of my topcoat , drew the cork , and passed it to her .
<< I >> could see she was shocked .
`` I'm sorry << I >> haven't got a glass '' , I said .
`` I'm sorry I haven't got a glass '' , << I >> said .
She tilted up and drank , and then << I >> drank .
It's really rotten to drink good cognac like that , but << I >> hadn't cared before .
<< I >> wasn't going to lug around a glass .
There wasn't much light in the blue dark , but << I >> could see her well .
<< I >> couldn't be sure .
<< I >> liked her , and all at once I was glad she was there .
I liked her , and all at once << I >> was glad she was there .
<< I >> suppose we were cold , but we didn't feel it .
<< I >> sensed no stranger in her .
<< I >> decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age .
<< I >> think we were very tired , for we awoke at the same moment , deeply rested , surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows , which were wet where the rime had melted .
<< I >> felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night's melancholy .
<< I >> was hungry as a wolf , and my body felt lean and vital .
`` Bon jour '' , << I >> said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips .
Maybe closer to thirty , << I >> thought .
With a laugh she beat << me >> to the bathroom .
She came out pink from a hot bath , and << I >> gave her my robe .
<< I >> had brushed my teeth , showered , shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast .
<< I >> gave it to the woman .
`` But << I >> already have ! !
<< I >> used yours '' .
<< I >> said with round eyes .
<< I >> wondered if I ought to go use the new one myself .

<< I >> grunted , sipping .
<< I >> raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror .
`` << I >> didn't really use yours '' , she went on .
<< I >> know men never kiss les putains '' .
<< I >> said with enthusiasm at the idea .
<< I >> put aside my empty cup .
The cynicism was back in her eyes , a bitter wisdom , and << I >> wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all .
The sommelier brought the wine first , a magnum instead of the bottle << I >> had ordered .
He must have thought << I >> was a tourist .
<< I >> didn't ask for a Jeroboam of champagne '' .
<< I >> thought that was pretty humorous , but I didn't laugh .
I thought that was pretty humorous , but << I >> didn't laugh .
The very night after her father's funeral she had thought , though never admitted to a soul : Now << I >> can go .
There's nothing to stop << me >> now .
And how on earth did << I >> ever get this letter anyway ? ?
This letter would have got to << me >> if she hadn't even put Rome , Italy , on it .
`` << I >> hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll just have to ! !
`` << I >> just hope this happens to you someday '' , said Cousin Elec , who was not at his best .
) `` << I >> hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them .

<< I >> really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought Theresa , it always makes me sick .
I really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought Theresa , it always makes << me >> sick .
It never registered with them that << I >> had time to read all of Balzac , Dickens , and Stendhal while Papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after Mother's operation .
It would have been exactly the same to them if << I >> had read through all twenty-six volumes of Elsie Dinsmore .
<< I >> knew it as surely as everybody in Westfield -- that Lucille was a husband stealer .
Just as it has its Susan Dolan , though nobody'd ever bothered to tell << me >> that .
Susan Dolan , that's << me >> .
They even talked about Lucille down at the Young Christians' League where << I >> spent a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission .
<< I >> never heard my folks talk about her , though .
Even if they ever did say anything about people like Lucille Warren , << I >> know they wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of me .
Even if they ever did say anything about people like Lucille Warren , I know they wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of << me >> .
My folks and my faith protected << me >> from things like that .
And so << I >> was really upset the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs. Warren .
And so I was really upset the first time << I >> discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs. Warren .
<< I >> asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck .
He gave << me >> a straight , honest answer .
Much as << I >> love you -- well , a guy's a guy and Lucille's willing to -- to come across .
Honest , kitten , that's all it is -- << I >> don't even like Lucille much '' .
My love for Johnnie was young and clean -- how could << I >> possibly compete with a woman like that , who didn't hesitate to use her sex .
He had an easy masculine grace about him , the kind that kids don't have , but that << I >> had sometimes admired in other older men .
The most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in << me >> , too .
<< I >> guess she was between affairs or something , but anyway , she had set her sights on Johnnie , my Johnnie .
<< I >> didn't like it one bit .
But what could << I >> do ? ?
And he wouldn't leave her either -- he'd told << me >> that .
Johnnie loved << me >> and wanted me .
Johnnie loved me and wanted << me >> .
But the only love << I >> was giving him was the pure kind .
`` It's so crazy '' , << I >> told him once .
`` << I >> always imagined I would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that .
`` I always imagined << I >> would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that .
`` << I >> could walk out the door '' .
`` Or << I >> could visit Lucille Warren '' .
`` << I >> might '' .
He'd just admitted it to << me >> .
Johnnie and << I >> had been innocent in our love , and that was the way I wanted to keep it .
Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love , and that was the way << I >> wanted to keep it .
At first , Johnnie hadn't understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like << me >> ? ?
<< I >> had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman .
<< I >> had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the Devil ! !
So one week later , << I >> surrendered to him in the little motel on Route 10 .
And , though at the time << I >> blushed to admit it even to myself , there was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that Johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever triggered .
And , though at the time I blushed to admit it even to myself , there was in << me >> a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that Johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever triggered .

Astonishingly enough , it was my own voice << I >> heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me .
Astonishingly enough , it was my own voice I heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to << me >> .
`` Love << me >> , Johnnie '' .
`` Will you always love << me >> this way '' ? ?
And << I >> snuggled closer to the man I loved .
And I snuggled closer to the man << I >> loved .
<< I >> had had no wedding ceremony , no witnesses , no certificate of marriage , but I had all the joy that goes with them .

<< I >> was practically a bride , after all .
Of this , << I >> had no doubt .
He'd not only told << me >> so , he'd proved it .
And if << I >> could contribute to that , I'd do it .
And << I >> had no doubts about how true this love was .
I'd never even petted with a boy , and after << I >> met Johnnie he never touched me for the longest while , not until I all but threw myself at him .

He was plenty attentive , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and << I >> figured that , emotionally , I was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half .
He was plenty attentive , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and I figured that , emotionally , << I >> was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half .
It wasn't , << I >> was sure , a difference in age that came between people , but a difference in maturity .
And hadn't << I >> rescued him from Lucille Warren ? ?
She'd have gotten him , if << I >> hadn't stopped her .
`` Love << me >> '' ? ?
<< I >> had mixed emotions about going .
I'd been seeing Johnnie almost a year now , but << I >> still didn't want to leave him for five whole days .
But << I >> had looked forward so much to being with this church group .
<< I >> hadn't been doing as much work as I used to in Westfield and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever .

My cousin Alma , at whose home << I >> was staying during the convention , introduced me to a group of young people from Rhode Island .
My cousin Alma , at whose home I was staying during the convention , introduced << me >> to a group of young people from Rhode Island .

I assumed Alma would get << me >> there , but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up , we were separated .
Outside the hall , << I >> anxiously looked around for her , then all at once there was a hand on my elbow .
<< I >> couldn't help laughing with him .
`` Well , << I >> should find Alma '' -- I began .
`` Well , I should find Alma '' -- << I >> began .
<< I >> went .
A couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and << I >> realized they were drinking .
But when Johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale , << I >> enjoyed it .
Of course << I >> enjoyed 'most anything if I did it with Johnnie .
Of course I enjoyed 'most anything if << I >> did it with Johnnie .
Johnnie << I >> suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening .
But that was only natural , << I >> decided ; ;
`` << I >> don't see Alma anywhere '' , I said .
`` I don't see Alma anywhere '' , << I >> said .
<< I >> drew back .
Not for << me >> '' .
But at least come along while << I >> get lubricated '' .
Strange faces , most of them , and << I >> wasn't even sure all of them had come from the League meeting .
`` << I >> hope so .
<< I >> must remember to warn the girl next to you in Larkspur .
`` << I >> spoke to the fellow next door , too '' , she might say .
<< I >> mean , she's still living , and she's ninety-six .
`` << I >> don't have a lemon '' .
`` Gee , neither do << I >> '' .

`` << I >> didn't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly .
`` You trying to say << I >> started the fight '' ? ?
<< I >> am saying you're not a professional ballplayer '' .
`` Now listen to << me >> , Phil .
`` Now don't tell << me >> what a good ball player you are .
Dazed , Phil said : `` << I >> don't get it .
That's what << I >> mean by no heart for the game .
`` << I >> think you're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally .
`` << I >> don't get it '' .
`` << I >> don't know '' , Phil said .
She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` << I >> was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you'd like it '' .

At one such gathering Charlotte announced , `` << I >> was at Ryusenji today .

`` << I >> shouldn't have been able to do that '' .
`` Well << I >> was able to do it '' , Charlotte said with no sign of irritation .

It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when << I >> put in the clutch .

Go out of the furrow , snake , << I >> said , but it did not move at all .
<< I >> pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out , hoping to frighten him with the noise , but the snake only flicked its black , forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel , without fright or concern .
<< I >> let the engine idle then , and I got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it .
I let the engine idle then , and << I >> got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it .
His flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as << I >> looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth .
You beauty , << I >> said , I couldn't kill you .

<< I >> picked him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and I could feel the coolness of that radiant , fire-colored body , like splendid ice , and I knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him , like fieldmice swallowed whole might make .

<< I >> lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , newly-plowed earth , from between my pale hands .
<< I >> felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake .
<< I >> had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house .
The earth was a little heavy and << I >> had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly , and I did not look back towards the place until I had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field , a long way from where I had stopped because of the snake .

<< I >> saw it all at a glance .
<< I >> could see the hunched-up shoulders , the savage determination , the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels , and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick .
Stop it , << I >> shouted , but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on , above anything I could say .

`` << I >> killed a snake ; ;
He tried to take my hand to show << me >> .
`` They are ugly and they eat chickens and << I >> hate snakes '' .
`` You are talking foolishly '' , << I >> said .
`` They're ugly and << I >> hate them '' , the boy insisted .
`` It was beautiful '' , << I >> said , half to myself .
The boy skipped along beside << me >> , and he was contented with what he had done .
The snake was hideous , and << I >> remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life .

`` I'm going to tell everybody how big a snake << I >> killed '' .

<< I >> could see the happiness in the boy's eyes , the gleeful brutality .
`` Don't '' , << I >> said .
He looked up at << me >> , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side .

`` It's a little contest Martin and << I >> have '' , she would begin gaily , carrying the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course .
<< I >> think Adam Herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side .

Viola greeted << me >> , in checked apron , ladle in hand , and explained it was the cook's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner .

`` You are bound to get involved with people when you have children '' , Fran had told << me >> at our first meeting , `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands , but People Who Do Things '' .
