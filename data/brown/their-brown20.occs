-- Although << there >> was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate .
Of course , if << there >> is a dust blanket around the Earth , the fluxes in interplanetary space should be less than the figures given here .

At the present time we do not know by what biochemical mechanism TSH acts on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone << there >> are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of Af .
The parenchyma was slightly hyperemic in the apex of the left lung , and << there >> were several firm , gray , fibrocalcific nodules measuring as large as 3 mm. .
For an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment , it must have four properties : ( 1 ) << there >> must be a fixed number of trials , ( 2 ) each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' ( a binomial trial ) , ( 3 ) all trials must have identical probabilities of success , ( 4 ) the trials must be independent of each other .
The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Af << there >> are families of such cubes .
Since the complex of singular lines is of order K and since << there >> is no complex of invariant lines , it follows from the formula Af that the order of the involution is Af .
Since two curves of symbol Af on Q intersect in Af points , it follows that << there >> are Af lines of Af which are tangent to Aj .
The first possibility requires that << there >> be a line through P which meets **zg in Af points ; ;
As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , << their >> cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; ;
We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for << their >> domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene .
In these rapidly changing societies << there >> is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals .

Prior to World War 2 , << there >> was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after World War 2 .
By << their >> pattern of endogamy and exogamy , the core families and the marginal families show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain .
The district officials , along with << their >> other duties , were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics .
Also , although only a few of the students were intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning , most reported that when the semester ended << their >> dearest and closest campus friendships were with members of that class .
Whereas a high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction , the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in << their >> areas of interest .
It was predicted that those who shifted in << their >> Kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor I which the investigators refer to as the `` Inferiority '' factor .

When informed that there were some persons who did not have << their >> arm go up , she commented , `` I don't see how they can prevent it '' .
One Kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the naive condition described her subjective experience as follows : `` You feel << they're >> going up and you're on a stage and it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's what's supposed to happen '' .
They knew that << their >> perceptual experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the aniseikonic lenses .
Individual differences in maturation and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate << their >> capacity for school achievement .
Over-achievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression line in << their >> school system .
We speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in << their >> school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment .

probably it is correct to think of it as a matter of a well-grooved , stereotyped mode of expression -- and no , or but a few , other communicational grooves , as yet -- being << there >> , available for the patient's use , as newly-emerging emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of months .
But when what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious , << there >> is normally only light stress or no stress at all .

If word classes differ in << their >> resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot , it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually .
The actual mean of 1.07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation , it is evident that << there >> is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement .
In proportion as meanings are concrete , we can better rely on << their >> being insulated and distinctive .
It was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta << there >> should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other .

Apart from some areas of recurring trouble , like Bani Mellal , where inexperienced officials had been appointed , << there >> is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process .
The government was most anxious that << there >> be a respectable response .
In addition , many large corporations operate << their >> own formal training programs .
Employers prefer to hire youth with such training rather than those without , and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to << their >> training .
Some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and << their >> desire to attract new industry .
While the U. S. Department of Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , << there >> is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning .
If << there >> is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere , many more workers can be expected to respond .

What with traders trading for so many different objectives , and what with << there >> being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading techniques in use , and more coming into use all the time , it is hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough `` fans '' to invalidate itself .

It permits referrals under certain circumstances even when << there >> is a labor dispute , provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute .
We found that a labor dispute existed , and that the workers had left << their >> jobs , which were then vacant because of the dispute .
that is , that if wages , for example , is the only issue in a labor dispute , and no workers have left << their >> jobs because of the dispute , we may continue to make referrals .

Therefore , if the sense of touch is functioning normally and << there >> is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary .

Fear of the competition -- always a great motivating force in the American economy -- makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of << their >> rival's shiny new branches .

Albert B.
