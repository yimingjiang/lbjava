If you've travelled in Europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on << your >> next visit across the Atlantic .
However , after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe , you'll want to change << your >> course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places .
You can call one of the car rental services directly ( Hertz , Avis , Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental , and others ) and ask them to reserve a car of << your >> choice , and some transportation lines offer this service as well .
You can wait , of course , until you arrive in Europe before renting << your >> car .
If you plan to visit any of these countries , you can obtain << your >> International Driving Permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3.00 .
Your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in << your >> group .
The basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve << your >> car , but some of them offer supplementary advantages .
There is the free intra-city `` rent it here , leave it there '' service , as an example , the free delivery and collection at the airport , dockside or << your >> hotel , luggage racks , touring documents and information and other similar services .

If you wish to budget closely on transportation , saving << your >> extra dollars to indulge in luxuries , one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at only $1.26 a day plus $.03 a kilometer and the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon , seating six , at just $1.10 a day and $.105 a kilometer .
If you will be using << your >> car more than fifteen days , which isn't all unlikely , the daily rates drop quite sharply to $.86 a day for the Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $.30 a day for the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon .
Further , there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you lease a car , and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and insured individually for << your >> trip .
Since most European cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars , it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less , but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize this , provided << your >> group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine .
However , whether you arrange to have a European or American model , if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in << your >> party , your transportation expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger .
However , whether you arrange to have a European or American model , if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in your party , << your >> transportation expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger .
This will include << your >> helpful , English-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day .
Of course , if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac limousine just for you and << your >> bride , you'll have a memorable tour , but it won't be cheap , and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes .
