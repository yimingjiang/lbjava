This emphasis upon death rather << than >> sin as man's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek-speaking ones .
If it was , << then >> it must have been God's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity .
If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather << than >> the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator .
If death receives more << than >> its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share , the gift of the life eternal through Christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence .

The Unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen -- as the term was << then >> understood in the Back Bay -- and Parker was definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners .

And he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them : `` Even the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria , and are worse << than >> those who deceived them '' -- which implied that they were very bad indeed .
We have to tell ourselves that when Parker spoke in this vein , he believed what he said , because he could continue , `` But the truth , which cost me bitter tears to say , I must speak , though it cost other tears hotter << than >> fire '' .
We have not the leisure , or the patience , or the skill , to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a << then >> recent graduate from the Harvard Divinity School who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor , the majesterial Andrews Norton , by saying that , while he believed Jesus `` like other religious teachers '' , worked miracles , `` I see not how a miracle proves a doctrine '' .
To ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower , and was not inspired directly by the Spirit of God , is asking me to accept a miracle far greater << than >> any of those recorded in the Bible .

This , however , is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict ( if both sides are strong enough ) can be war of all against all no less << than >> if other means are used .
It also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained above , and this means far more << than >> in the choice of non-violent means .
A trial of strength , however , is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values << than >> those of his opponent ; ;

In 1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a `` state's-responsibility '' proposal -- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather << than >> by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus .
The content is not the same , however : rather << than >> individual security , it is the security and continuing existence of an `` ideological group '' -- those in the `` free world '' -- that is basic .

But it is more << than >> that .
While the pattern is uneven , some having gained more << than >> others , nationalism has in fact served the Western peoples well .
But it is more << than >> irony : one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet .
The nation-state , << then >> , exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty : supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control .

The present issue in Atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather << than >> the one that was resolved by Civil War .

Alley fences were made of solid boards higher << than >> one's head , but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them .
The only extended view possible to anyone less tall << than >> the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree .

This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather << than >> the highroad .
The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis << than >> did Plato .
I have chosen to use the word `` mimesis '' in its Christian rather << than >> its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the Christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the Greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection .
In the first instance , `` mimesis '' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather << than >> in terms of abstract ideas or conventional designations .
Neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other << than >> signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs .
Our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past << than >> our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future .

For the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers , << then >> the `` open house '' system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door .
We assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater << than >> the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in Figure 2 .
With troops dispersed on fields of battle rather << than >> on the parade ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication .
The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network << than >> a factory , a college , or a rural village .
( B ) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more << than >> about six consecutive times .
It will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the networks in vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied << than >> is usually put into practice .
And the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather << than >> economic .
Should the accelerating growth of technology << then >> warn us ? ?
If we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions foster rather << than >> hamper man ; ;

Research , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better << than >> the real mothers .
The discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the President's decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather << than >> a medical , problem .
Because the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the President , rather << than >> with his doctors , nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure .
But the problem is one which gives us the measure of a man , rather << than >> a group of men , whether a group of doctors , a group of party members assembled at a dinner to give their opinion , or the masses of the voters .
The press conference became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking , rather << than >> his convictions .

`` I may possibly be a greater risk << than >> is the normal person of my age '' , the President had said on February 29th of the election year , ignoring the fact that no one of his age had ever lived out another term .
Ironically no president we have had would have regretted more << than >> President Eisenhower the possibility to which his own words , in the press conference held at the beginning of August , testified : that unable as he was himself to say his running was best for the country , unconsciously he had placed his party before his nation .
He ascribes to the mercy of God the peace which this personal matter -- the assurance that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer << than >> any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do -- has brought him .
Drifting through a third illness , apparently without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency other << than >> a talk with the vice-president , Eisenhower revealed the singularly static quality of his thinking .
This means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful << than >> those anchoring the existent form in being .
I am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst's consulting room , but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies << than >> tragedy in life .
Now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more << than >> the irresistible unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history .
Incest is still a durable theme , but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions , and there is no better way to do this << than >> that of concealment and symbolic representation .
Mann understood better << than >> most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell .

The fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern , I rather think , for the South has been no more solid << than >> other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity .

Such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions << than >> they had in the earlier writers ; ;
In light of all this , one would require special reasons for saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other << than >> circular .

Analogously , anyone who argues that Einstein's theory of gravitation is simpler << than >> Newton's , must say rather more to explain how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists , while the former can be managed ( with difficulty ) only by accomplished experts .

Whether you experienced the passion of desire I have , of course , no way of knowing , nor indeed have I wished with even the most fleeting fragment of a wish to know , for the fact that one constitutes by one's mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any speculation upon this part of one's parents' experience more immodest , more scandalizing , more deeply unwelcome << than >> an obscenity from a stranger .

Now and << then >> , the President would call for `` Little Jack , Master of the Hounds '' , which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the White House since Teddy Roosevelt's administration , and discuss the welfare of some one of the animals .
Mama didn't know what to do -- whether to tell on Rob Roy or not -- since she had the ear of Mrs. Coolidge more << than >> the other maids .
<< then >> he would bark to let everyone know the coast was clear .
Finally , Mama did mention to Mrs. Coolidge that she felt sorry for the little dogs , and << then >> Mrs. Coolidge decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone , even though her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity .
A new bill had been passed under Harding that designated the Government , rather << than >> the President , as the tab-lifter for official meals .
The genuinely interesting question , << then >> , becomes : What factors determine the degree of realism or distortion in conventional images of Jews ? ?
In free countries many controversies involve self-styled Jews who use the symbol in asserting a vaguely `` cultural '' rather << than >> religious or political identity .
However , in the context of legal and civic policy , these controversies are less << than >> novel .
In essence this involves grounding one's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather << than >> in one's own values and experience .
In the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects << than >> the control of love and hate .
William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks , it seems to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected : `` For if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation ) -- << then >> it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affections at all .
An idea , of the sort that we have in mind , although of necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in connotation << than >> most poetic or literary images , especially those appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience .
`` You could come down to the office once a day , look over a few exchanges , dictate an editorial , and << then >> have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary labors .
Hearst had spent more << than >> $60,000 of his own money in the probe , but still Attorney General Knox was quiescent .
They had watered their stock at immense profit , << then >> had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton , netting themselves another $20,000,000 in annual profit .
What I want is to have this evidence come before Congress and if the Attorney General does not report it , as I am very sure he won't , as he has refused to do anything of the kind , I << then >> wish that a committee of seven Representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence .
They had lost twice with the radical Bryan , and were having no part of Hearst , whom they considered more radical << than >> Bryan .
But the Garibaldi volumes were more << than >> a romantic story .
Trevelyan accepts Italian nationalism with little analysis , he is unduly critical of papal and French policy , and he is more << than >> generous in assessing British policy .
Published in 1923 , it did not gain the popular acclaim of the Garibaldi volumes , probably because Trevelyan felt less at home with Manin , the bourgeois lawyer , << than >> with Garibaldi , the filibuster .
Some historians have found his point of view not to their taste , others have complained that he makes the Tory tradition appear `` contemptible rather << than >> intelligible '' , while a sympathetic critic has remarked that the `` intricate interplay of social dynamics and political activity of which , at times , politicians are the ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents '' .
More temperately << than >> in the study of Grey and despite his Liberal bias , Trevelyan vividly sketches the England of pre-French Revolution days , portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich colors , and brings developments leading to the Reform Bill into sharp and clear focus .
The History takes too much for granted to serve as a text for other << than >> English schoolboys , and like Britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorates badly as it goes beyond 1870 .
`` Is this << then >> the frontier '' ? ?
`` I must << then >> be standing on the line between France and Germany '' .
`` Ah , << then >> please tell me where the frontier is because this gentleman here '' -- I indicated the French occupation officer -- `` informs me that Germany is just on the other side of him '' .

This prospect did not please Mrs. King any more << than >> did the possibility that her daughter might marry a Bohemian , but she used it to suggest to Thompson that , `` It is not in her nature to love you '' .
In a letter to Meynell , which was written in June , less << than >> a month before Katie's wedding , he was highly melodramatic in his despair and once again announced his intention of returning to the life of the streets : ``
Meynell once again paid his debts and it was Katie , rather << than >> Thompson , whose life was soon ended , for she died in childbirth in April , 1901 , in the first year of her marriage .
The somewhat Petrarchan love story which these poems suggest cannot obscure the fact that undoubtedly they have more << than >> a little of autobiographical sincerity .
My own stern hand has rent the ancient bond , And thereof shall the ending not have end : But not for me , that loved her , to be fond Lightly to please me with a newer friend Then hold it more << than >> bravest-feathered song , That I affirm to thee , with heart of pride , I knew not what did to a friend belong Till I stood up , true friend , by thy true side ; ;
That she was affected by his protestations seems obvious , but since she was evidently a sensible young woman -- as well as an outgoing and sympathetic type -- it would seem that for her the word friendship had a far less intense emotional significance << than >> that which Thompson gave it .
The poems which were addressed to her , while they are far more restrained << than >> those of `` Love In Dian's Lap '' , show no great technical advance over those of the `` Narrow Vessel '' group and are , if anything , somewhat more labored .
Thence he pushed farther south << than >> he had ever been before into Podolia and Nogay Tartary or the Yedisan .
During a sojourn of slightly more << than >> three months Chamberlain Littlepage could see action on both elements .
Among the visitors arriving every now and << then >> there were , of course , women .

In the next few months of comparative silence , Pike waited patiently until conditions were perfect for a new attack , and << then >> , displaying a remarkable grasp of the subtleties of political infighting , gained from his first bout with Woodruff , he used these changed conditions to excellent advantage .
Pomham and Soconoco , a couple of minor sachems ( of something less << than >> exalted character ) under Miantonomi , declared that they had never assented to the sale of land to Gorton and had never received anything for it .
You may do well to take notice , that besides the title to land between the English and the Indians there , there are twelve of the English that have subscribed their names to horrible and detestable blasphemies , who are rather to be judged as blasphemous << than >> they should delude us by winning time under pretence of arbitration '' .
And << then >> it took considerably longer to make preparations for giving transfusions .

For them only a little more needed to be learned , and << then >> all physical knowledge could be neatly sorted , packaged and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution of any human problem .
For this reason , << then >> , poetry tends to weaken the power of control , the reason , because it tempts one to indulge his passions , and even the best of men , he maintains , may be corrupted by this subtle influence .
Aristotle's method in the Poetics , << then >> , does suggest that we should isolate the work .
For this reason , << then >> I want to describe , first , two examples of the puritanical attacks : Stephen Gosson's The School Of Abuse , 1579 , and his later Playes Confuted , published in 1582 .
With that act of Parliament the opponents of the stage won the day , and for more << than >> two decades after that England had no legitimate public drama .
Even in such technical curricula as engineering , the senior is much more likely << than >> the freshman to choose , as an ideal , liberal education over specific vocational preparation .
and many a hopeful incipient business executive decides it were better to teach the theory of business administration << than >> to practice it .
This finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are more likely to be supporters of the values implicit in civil liberties << than >> the other students .
The British , although suffering considerable losses , noted the defection of the Marylanders , made a stand , << then >> turned and attacked Morgan who became greatly outnumbered and had to retire .
In late December , the American army moved from Whitemarsh to Valley Forge , and although the distance was only 13 miles , the journey took more << than >> a week because of the bad weather , the barefooted and almost naked men .
The headquarters of Morgan was on a farm , said to have been particularly well located so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the British , a practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for British gold rather << than >> the virtually worthless Continental currency .
The troops must have more << than >> the common quantity of liquor , and perhaps there will be some little drunkenness among them '' .
Bad relations between England and Flanders brought hard times to the shepherds scattered over the dales and downs as well as to the crowded Flemish cities , and while the English , so far , had done no more << than >> grumble , Othon had seen what the discontent might lead to , for before he left the Low Countries the citizens of Ghent had risen in protest against the expense of supporting Edward and his troops , and the regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly difficult to put down the nasty little riot that ensued .
I became fifteen , sixteen , << then >> twenty , and still Tessie Alpert sat on the porch with a rose in her hair , and Alfred got richer and sicker with diabetes .
Mr. Banks was always called Banks the Butcher until he left town and the shop passed over to Meltzer the Scholar who << then >> became automatically Meltzer the Butcher .
When these chores were finished , only << then >> , was she allowed whatever freedom she could find .
And with the publication of E. T. Leeds' Archaeology Of The Anglo-Saxon Settlements the student was presented with an organized synthesis of the archaeological data << then >> known .
Without a precise knowledge of Germanic philology , however , it is debatable whether their use was not more often a source of confusion and error << than >> anything else .
For it is their catastrophic concept of the Anglo-Saxon invasions rather << than >> Kemble's gradualist approach which dominates the field .
It was the first American war in which the death rate from disease was lower << than >> that from battle , due to the provision of trained medical personnel ( of the 200,000 officers , 42,000 were physicians ) , compulsory vaccination , rigorous camp sanitation , and adequate hospital facilities .
To the middle of September 1918 , there had been fewer << than >> 10,000 deaths from disease in the new army .
The intimations of a related spirit and ordering of human values are stronger << than >> any sense of disparity .
Shakespeare is closer to Sophocles << than >> he is to Pope and Voltaire .
It is only << then >> that the ancient habits of feeling and the classic orderings of material and psychological experience were abandoned .
The thunderclaps over the sacred wood at Colonus and the storms in King Lear are caused by more << than >> weather .
Since more is known about Quiney << than >> about any other acquaintance of Shakespeare in Stratford , his career may be followed to its sudden end in 1602 .
The desire to substantiate a thesis at the expense of sound research technique smacks more of the propagandist << than >> the historian .
If the historian was convinced of his own correctness , << then >> he should not allow his vision to become fogged by disturbing facts .
What was perhaps more important << than >> his concept of the nature of history and the historical method were those forces which shaped the direction of his thought .
But it was nothing more << than >> that .
The relic worship and monasticism of the Middle Ages were more advanced forms << than >> were primitive fetish worship and nature myths .
Moreover , he had spent six months on the Galapagos islands , among the great turtles that Captain Cook had found there , and now and << then >> he would disappear into some small island of the West Indies .
I had always thought of that lovable man as many years older << than >> myself , although he was perhaps only twenty years older , and he confirmed my feeling , along with the feeling of both my sons , that teachers of the classics are invariably endearing .
Two or three times , C. C. Burlingham came to lunch with us in Weston , that wonderful man who lived to be more << than >> a hundred years old and whose birthplace had been my Wall Street suburb .
He looked at her as she spoke , << then >> got up as she was speaking still , and , simply and wordlessly , walked out .
And she withdrew << then >> to Cromwell Hall , in Cromwell , Connecticut .
Blackman arrived a day or two early , and Lewis took him to a department store immediately and outfitted him , luggage and all , and << then >> he took him to a party at the Woodwards that went on until four in the morning .
After a dinner party for which she had come down to New York , Mrs. Lewis and Casanova arrived to see them off , and Elinor Wylie made tart observations that indicated that Lewis had been less discreet << than >> he had promised to be about the real nature of their separation .
Lewis , at the head of the table , would leap up and move around behind the chairs of his guests making remarks that , when not highly offensive , were at least highly inappropriate , and << then >> presently he collapsed and was put to bed .
When Blackman emerged from the bedroom , everyone was gone except the tolerant Lord Thomson , who stayed and chatted with him for half an hour , and << then >> Blackman lay awake most of that night , despairing of what he must expect on the Continent .
Lewis warned him never to lay a hand on him , and << then >> Blackman asked for his fare back to the United States .
Lewis looked at him and began to cry , and << then >> , saying that he was going to make a promise , he asked Blackman to call the porter and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he did not want .
Then he kept Blackman awake for more << than >> an hour while he did an imaginary dialogue between his wife and himself in which , discussing the evening , he was continually berated .
As the total number of incepting bachelors in 1629 was , according to Masson ( Life , 1:218 ) and n , two hundred fifty-nine , the twenty-four names listed in the ordo senioritatis for that year constitute slightly less << than >> one tenth of the total number of bachelors who then incepted .

Small wonder that Milton later boasted of how well his work had been received there , since he attained a rank in the order of commencing bachelors higher << than >> that of any other inceptor from Christ's of that year .
It is not possible to reconstruct fully the arrangements whereby these honors lists were << then >> made up or even how the names that they contained assumed the order in which we find them .
He could produce carefully constructed orations , set and formal speeches , artfully and prayerfully made by writing and rewriting with all the aid his tutor and others could provide , and << then >> delivered verbatim from memory .
He was << then >> a slightly built young man of pleasing appearance , medium stature , and handsome face .
But these prolusions that we have surviving from the Christ's College days are only one phase of his existence << then >> .
Considering << then >> the optimism which has permeated science fiction for so long , what is really remarkable is that during the last twelve years many science-fiction writers have turned about and attacked their own cherished vision of the future , have attacked the Childhood's End kind of faith that science and technology will inevitably better the human condition .
and among works of dystopian science fiction , not all provide intelligent criticism and very few have much merit as literature -- but << then >> real quality has always been scarce in science fiction .
Easily the best known of these three novels is The Space Merchants , a good example of a science-fiction dystopia which extrapolates much more << than >> the impact of science on human life , though its most important warning is in this area , namely as to the use to which discoveries in the behavioral sciences may be put .
The novel , which is not merely dystopian but also brilliantly satiric , describes a future America where one-sixteenth of the population , the men who run advertising agencies and big corporations , control the rest of the people , the submerged fifteen-sixteenths who are the workers and consumers , with the government being no more << than >> `` a clearing house for pressures '' .
If man is actually the product of his environment and if science can discover the laws of human nature and the ways in which environment determines what people do , << then >> someone -- a someone probably standing outside traditional systems of values -- can turn around and develop completely efficient means for controlling people .
And to do this requires first of all the kind of information about people which is provided by the scientists in industrial anthropology and consumer research , who , for example , tell Courtenay that three days is the `` optimum priming period for a closed social circuit to be triggered with a catalytic cue-phrase '' -- which means that an effective propaganda technique is to send an idea into circulation and << then >> three days later reinforce or undermine it .
An assumption of youth , or the presence of a few youthful characteristics , deceives no more successfully << than >> rouge or dyed hair .
Its surface loses its bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways less immediately obvious << than >> the body does .
The pessimism of the young is defiant , anxious to confess or even exaggerate its ostensible gloom , and so exuberant as to reveal the fact that it regards its ability to face up to the awful truth as more << than >> enough to compensate for the awfulness of that truth .
Even to be `` from hope and fear set free '' is at least better << than >> to have lost the first without having got rid of the second .
Fundamental values , temperament and the way in which one approaches a conviction change less , of course , << than >> specific opinions .
But in ways more fundamental << than >> specific political opinions they are still what they always were : passionate , sure without a shadow of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of , capable of seeing black and white only and , therefore , committed to the logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to .
Several times in my youth I voted the Socialist ticket , but less because I was Socialist << than >> because I was not either a Republican or a Democrat , and I voted for Franklin Roosevelt every time he was a candidate .
There are few things of which I am prouder << than >> of that unblemished record .
When I first came across Samuel Johnson's pronouncement , `` the remedy for the ills of life is palliative rather << than >> radical '' , it seemed to me to sum up the profoundest of political and social truths .
I would , however , like to suggest that , wrong though I may be , the tendency to see dilemmas rather << than >> solutions is one of which I have been a victim ever since I can remember , and therefore not merely a senile phenomenon .
and has << then >> gone on to argue , with unimpeachable consistency , that all the obviously non-propagandistic aspects of the book are simply inadvertent `` contradictions '' .

and Vincent Berger learns that political ambition is more apt to hide << than >> to reveal the truth about men .
It may well be that the unification of Europe will prove inadequate , that the survival of free society will require nothing less << than >> the confederation of the entire Western world .
In 1949 the Council of Europe came into existence , a purely consultative parliamentary body but the first organ of political rather << than >> functional unity .
Indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle << than >> NATO for the development of a parliamentary organ of the Atlantic nations , because it could encompass all of the members of the Atlantic community including those , like Sweden and Switzerland , who are unwilling to be associated with an essentially military alliance like Aj .

Had Krim gone farther from New York << than >> Chapel Hill , he might have discovered that large numbers of American Jews do not find his New York version of the Jews' lot remotely recognizable .
More important is the simple human point that all men suffer , and that it is a kind of anthropological-religious pride on the part of the Jew to believe that his suffering is more poignant << than >> mine or anyone else's .
The work for Commonweal was more satisfying << than >> work for Commentary `` because of the staff's tiptoeing fear of making a booboo '' .

Around that statue in the green park where children play and lovers walk in twos and there is a glowing view of the whole city , in that park are the rows of marble busts of Garibaldi's fallen men , the ones who one day rushed out of the Porta San Pancrazio and , under fire all the way , up the long , straight narrow lane to take , << then >> lose the high ground of the Villa Doria Pamphili .
`` We would see it that way , but it was glorious << then >> .
The whole thing , from the moment when they jumped heavily off the trucks , spread out and moved into position just behind the cover of that slight rise of ground and << then >> jumped off , took maybe between twenty and thirty minutes .
And << then >> there were other things .
Others have so-called development plans , but some of these are little more << than >> lists of projects collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals without analysis of the actions required to attain them .
More importantly , several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more << than >> that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence .
In my short period here I believe that at no time has he been otherwise << than >> the most popular man on both sides of the aisle .
And , if we follow the Rayburn pattern , as consciously or by an instinctual political sense I like to think I have followed it , << then >> the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country .
More << than >> that , Sam Rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition .
I pay my personal tribute to Sam Rayburn , stalwart Texan and great American , not only because today he establishes a record of having served as Speaker of the House of Representatives more << than >> twice as long as Henry Clay , but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half century of service as a Member of Congress .
No greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in this House << than >> to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great Speaker , this great legislator , this great Texan , this great American .
I prefer to speak , however , of Sam Rayburn , the person , rather << than >> Sam Rayburn , the American institution .
Unit prices to the state are considerably lower << than >> to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise taxes .
Rhode Island's rate of $.07 per mile is considerably lower << than >> reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally which approximate a $.09 per mile average .

It handles all types of vehicle maintenance , but concentrates more on `` service station activities '' << than >> on extensive vehicle repairs .
Based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car << than >> by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles .
Unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower << than >> to the general public .
This financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax , or at least at the rates << then >> existing , insufficient for their requirements .
The resulting setup , it was declared , `` would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger << than >> Rhode Island '' .
It would seem , << then >> , that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property .

The 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and allocations -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater << than >> that within which they provide useful service .
But during nighttime hours the skywave radiations are reflected from the ionosphere , thereby creating the possibility of one station's rendering service , via skywave , at a much greater distance << than >> it can through its groundwave signal , and at the same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies .
Because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions , it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the AM band , with many more stations operating during the day << than >> at night .
During nighttime hours , because of the intense skywave propagation << then >> prevailing , no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels , if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it .
Since << then >> , there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it , leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena .

First of all , as we had surmised , the highly compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly better ( Af ) on achievement << than >> do similar children in the unstructured schools .
Our conjecture is , << then >> , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work .

Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better << than >> average in the structured setting .
The position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary << than >> typing and clerking positions .
At the end of work one day , the personnel man took the applicants one at a time , asked them to sit behind the receptionist's desk and he << then >> played the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes .

More << than >> anything , it is the therapist's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a spread-out deck of cards , on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient's and his months of work together .
Or an `` I want to go home '' , or whatever -- but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more << than >> one latent meaning .
and which , more often << than >> all these , conveys a welter of feelings which could in no way be conveyed by any number of words , words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another .
Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is , more often << than >> not , entirely unaware .
Thus , when more << than >> one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the X-region , a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms , one cell in the chain for each form .

It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems << than >> with consonants or vowels .
By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems << than >> the over-simple distinction between register and contour languages .
Since tone systems typically comprise fewer units << than >> either consonant or vowel systems , we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis .

There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister of the Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less << than >> enthusiastic .
The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather << than >> an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco .
The overall effect was probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections << than >> might have otherwise taken place .
The P.D.I. and later the Popular Movement protected the Istiqlal's `` privileged position '' until the fall of Balafrej , and << then >> the Istiqlal used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the pro-U.N.F.P. tendencies of the Ibrahim government .

The purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already in use , so that he might << then >> be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that is to follow , and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead .
It seems likely , moreover , that with an increase in the rate of saving in mortgage lending institutions , interest rates on residential mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year , although the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily in other terms << than >> interest rate , e.g. , easier downpayment and amortization terms .
Moreover , it is likely that Federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster rate of economic growth of the country , to keep ahead of the Communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better << than >> theirs , will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas such as education , housing , medical aid , and the like .
Because of its importance , and because the lack of price competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more << than >> could be justified by cost increases .
Public indignation and resistance to wage-price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3% per annum << than >> when the increases are on the order of 3% per month .
Finally , since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call for less << than >> proportionately larger price increases ( e.g. , if a wage increase of 5% allows a price increase of 7% , a wage increase of 10% allows a price increase of something less than 14% ) .
Finally , since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call for less than proportionately larger price increases ( e.g. , if a wage increase of 5% allows a price increase of 7% , a wage increase of 10% allows a price increase of something less << than >> 14% ) .
In this model , << then >> , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise .
From this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive << than >> assumed in our model .

A recent case in point is Mitchell Canneries v. United States , in which a claim against the Government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership , whose partners were former stockholders , and << then >> to another corporation formed by the partners .
In an earlier case , Kingan & Co. v. United States , an American corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a British corporation in exchange for its own stock and << then >> liquidating the British corporation .

Furthermore , in a C reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater << than >> is necessary in a statutory merger , to which the statute is clearly inapplicable .

What were they to do , << then >> , with these awkward judgments of value ? ?

It seems clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more << than >> the usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision .

And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more << than >> the foregoing facts ( mentioned above under 1 ) , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; ;

As one would surmise , the procedure , however , could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape , which the patient << then >> immediately could determine by a kind of inference .
Perhaps the very important question -- What is , << then >> , exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things ? ?
How , << then >> , do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this ? ?
Quite naturally , they make the investigation , first , by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at all and << then >> , later , by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to .

If , on the other hand , they opted for representation , it had to be representation per se -- representation as image pure and simple , without connotations ( at least , without more << than >> schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed .
It was because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason -- that is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of depicted objects , or at least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque's and Picasso's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there -- but only as flattened silhouettes -- << than >> in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 .

Consequently , the system giving area coverage ( if such coverage is less << than >> world wide ) must be flexible and hence at least partially mobile .
All capabilities must be used to maximum advantage << then >> .
Variations in sound velocity should be measured rather << than >> temperature , because more of the variables would be encompassed .
It was observed that EWC macromolecules are the same diameter ( 15 a. ) but much longer ( up to several microns ) << than >> vertebrate tropocollagen .
Gallium oxide is less volatile << than >> silica ( the main constituent of tektites ) and germanium oxide is more volatile .
Upon completion of the purging step , additional initiator appropriate for the molecular weight of the sample desired is added , and the system is << then >> warmed to the polymerization temperature , at which the reaction is allowed to go to completion .
The predictability of the molecular weights was found to be within 10% for the polymers prepared , with Af ratios less << than >> 1.1 .
Interest remained , however , in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs << than >> freezing , or without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations .
A number of foods are quite acceptable as regards taste and palatability , however , at dosages substantially less << than >> sterilization levels .
For irradiation of food , the results obtained depend upon the dose rather << than >> the specific type of radiation , and X-ray , gamma , and high-energy electron radiation are suitable .
Irradiation using the nuclide source is more expensive << than >> use of an electron accelerator .
What << then >> , are the factors that contribute to these phenomena ? ?
Why should the `` practical adhesion '' of a coating as assessed by a knife method change , initially increasing rather rapidly and << then >> decreasing stepwise to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing thickness ? ?
The convoluted sheets can be combined to attain certain cushioning effects mechanically rather << than >> chemically .
Closed molding generally resulted in parts weighing more ( because of higher density ) << than >> parts fabricated from free-blown foams .
In a typical application -- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels -- an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to 20% more << than >> the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top of the panel is locked in place by a jig .
This test method is intended for determining the dimensional changes of woven or knitted fabrics , made of fibers other << than >> wool , to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home .
The water inlets are large enough to permit filling the wheel to an eight-inch level in less << than >> two minutes , and the outlet is large enough to permit discharge of this same amount of water in less than two minutes .

Distances of less << than >> 10 inches are not recommended .
The specimen of fabric is a rectangle at least 22 by 22 inches , except for cloth narrower << than >> 22 inches , in which case the specimen is the entire width of the fabric .
The magnification may be smaller , equal , or larger << than >> unity .
Thus , the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two fiber plates ( with a combined efficiency of 0.25 ) is 0.043 or about six times less << than >> that of the two fiber plates .
It has been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system yields a lower resolution << than >> a magnifying system or a system with unity magnification .
But even more important << than >> this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy , namely , that for the given feed state and R stages .
But Af is vastly larger << than >> R .
Then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more << than >> three millennia ! !
If we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next , << then >> the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first .
And << then >> : `` There are lots of kids around here '' .
Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly now , as allies who are political rather << than >> natural might in a war atmosphere .
He thought about it briefly , << then >> deliberately turned the talk to something else .
The heavy branches in his front yard would hide and << then >> reveal them .
Rachel came close to the bed , bent as if she would kiss him , << then >> moved away .
`` She didn't really say '' -- She glanced away at the floor , << then >> swooped gracefully and picked up one of Scotty's slippers .
We'll wait till you're stronger and << then >> talk about it '' .
Scotty would hear the front door in the evening and << then >> his father's deep slow voice ; ;
<< then >> they turned to the right , climbed the embankment , and walked into the valley again .
The gentle whir of each footstep left him more naked << than >> before , until he felt his unprotected flesh tremble , chilled by each new sound .
The sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud , << then >> reflected to the earth in a softer , diffused radiance .
And << then >> the questions came , eager , interested questions , and many compliments on his having overcome his infirmity .
A romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and all he has to do is find the right key , and << then >> divine justice and altruism will appear .
But << then >> his son could afford it .
The Vice President said with a slight bluster , `` There isn't anyone who loves the President more << than >> I do .
It began invariably in low tones , almost conversational , and << then >> gradually worked up to high , shrill appeals to God and man .
And << then >> the Amen corner took hold , re-enacting a form of group participation in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek chorus , spreading down through the African forest , overseas to the West Indies , and then here in Alabama .
And then the Amen corner took hold , re-enacting a form of group participation in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek chorus , spreading down through the African forest , overseas to the West Indies , and << then >> here in Alabama .
But << then >> , at mention of that name , the Amen corner broke loose .
Two gas lamps were no more << than >> a misleading glow .
Frederick Seward said his father was sleeping , and << then >> went through a pantomime at his father's door , to prove the statement .
Payne was more methodical << than >> that .
An open field was better << than >> a building , that was for sure , so he dismounted , turned off the horse , and plunged through the grass .
On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better << than >> usual .
Katie reared a third time , << then >> , trembling , descended .
But << then >> one day , while on a week's visit to the country home of a retired Swiss jeweler , Rousseau amused the company with a few little melodies he had written , to which he attached no great importance .
`` This is the sort of stuff I write and << then >> throw away '' ! !
But << then >> , after the little operetta had been given its feeble amateur rendering , everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever , and that the Royal Academy of Music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited .
Afraid at one and the same time that his work might be turned down -- which would be a blow to his pride even though no one knew he was the author -- and that the work would be accepted , and << then >> that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself .
`` If they are here , << then >> surely I have the right to be here '' , Rousseau said .
I put a lot more trust in my two legs << than >> in the gun , because the most important thing I had learned about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it .
the passage and rhythm of time changed , and when I remember back to what happened << then >> , each event is a separate and frozen incident .
Yet it could not have been more << than >> a matter of seconds , and then the front of the British army came into view .
Yet it could not have been more than a matter of seconds , and << then >> the front of the British army came into view .

and << then >> I came to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I outdistanced Cousin Simmons by far .
We were less << than >> a quarter of a mile from the road , and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it .
They tried to outface him , but Joseph Simmons was as wide as two average men , and it would have taken braver men << than >> these were to outface him .
He stood very still , his arms at his sides , staring up at the heavens , << then >> down at the blinking lights below .
One , more horrible << than >> the rest , lunged , growling deep in his throat , his hair bristling .
Southern California gasped and blinked under an autumn hot spell , drier , more enervating , more laden with man's contrived impurities << than >> the worst days of the summer past .
In the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room , and << then >> they went across the hall to the kitchen .
And put water on to boil and << then >> searched through the icebox .
He didn't , but it was not really a question , and so he left the room , walked down the hall to the front of the apartment , hesitated , and << then >> knocked lightly on the closed door of the study .
Eugene put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and << then >> filled it with hot water .
Then came their bathroom , and << then >> a bedroom that , judging by the photographs on the walls , must belong to Mme Cestre .
The clock on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and << then >> quickly left the room .
He waited until they were inside the elevator and << then >> said : `` Now what do we do '' ? ?
Rather << than >> sit around waiting for the suitcases to be delivered , they had gone sight-seeing .
So something like this matters more << than >> it would at home .
They took Jesus's body , << then >> , and wrapped it in winding-clothes with the spices ; ;
He improvised as he went along , completing a life-size clay figure , << then >> bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber , to the consistency of thick mud .
He << then >> draped him over the rough stand , explained that he was supposed to be recently dead , and was being held on his mother's lap .
The thin legs twitched convulsively once , << then >> Kate felt the little body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound .
Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and << then >> empty of images .
The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather << than >> the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood memories .
The road seemed animated with a few more wagons << than >> usual ; ;
Things like that would increase rather << than >> be done away with .
It is harder , he muttered , to meditate on man ( or woman ) << than >> on God .
As the camp emptied , it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around Lublin , << then >> by deportees from outside Poland .
She just about made me carry her upstairs and << then >> she clung to me and wouldn't let me go .
Still I didn't think she was twotiming me with Precious right << then >> .
As long as there were two human beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no more escape it << than >> you could expect to escape the grave .
If he wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers << than >> if he tried to get them by indirection .
`` Unless the oyabun has been working on it '' , he said , << then >> checked himself and added : `` You can tell Kayabashi-san that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use '' .
The secretary sighed with relief and << then >> the telephone clicked in Rector's hand .
When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , << then >> he went outside to inspect the grounds .
He told her of the visitors and << then >> of his plans .
<< then >> , to better purpose , he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers , untied it .
From the outside , it seemed no more << than >> a low drumlin , a lump on the dark earth .
A feeling of futility , an enervation of mind greater << than >> any fatigue he had ever known , seeped through him .
Watson snorted and << then >> laughed aloud .
If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes , say , << then >> the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud .
He was no heavier << than >> a child .
These trumps were more touching << than >> they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights were long , her children ungrateful , and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare .
`` I'll have a drink , << then >> , if you'll have one with me '' .
<< then >> she snorted and groped for her fork .
There's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green beans on the silver fork , << than >> the dwindling away of a family .
When the fate of the individual is visited on the group , << then >> ( the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently ) , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted .

Mark easily looked years older << than >> himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized .
He's an even bigger fool << than >> you are .
If we had , << then >> one of us would have had to go instead .
She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she'd go , and << then >> she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat .
he rose at half-past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday's Herald Tribune and yesterday's Pittsburgh Gazette , << then >> put on his high-topped farmer's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop .
she could dust the plants , << then >> break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on ; ;
She went into the living room and turned on three lamps , << then >> back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway .
`` He's a right smart younger << than >> the rest '' ? ?
`` He's ten years younger << than >> Ernest .
<< then >> , hearing the muffled boom of Howard's laughter , blushed redder .
Bobby Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting , and Uncle Bill Farnworth ( from Mama Albright's side of the family ) said he would just get up from there and take them , right << then >> .
The ledger was full of most precise information : date of laying , length of incubation period , number of chick reaching the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of rooster's wattles and so on , all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese << than >> English , the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen .
It was << then >> that they heard the tread of one descending and , in some perturbation glancing up , saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing .
The doctor sat down rather wearily , caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry-loving man , but no sooner was the remark out << than >> a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more .
They waited three minutes and << then >> crept out on tip-toe ; ;
`` Chickens have short memories '' , the doctor remarked , `` that's why they are better company << than >> most people I know '' , and he went on to break some important news to Alex .
`` Well '' , he began , `` It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me << than >> those fellers over at the conference house do .
Seems like she's willing , but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy who took Jeannie May behind the barn and << then >> didn't know what to do , and the people at the zoo haven't got any vulture chicks to show for their trouble .
Going downstairs with the tray , Winston wished he could have given in to Miss Ada , but he knew better << than >> to do what she said when she had that little-girl look .
Since << then >> , the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill .
Nothing in all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow << than >> the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world .
I looked over their faces and felt a twinge : they all looked so much more knowing << than >> I .
My father's a policeman and makes less << than >> seven thousand dollars a year .
`` I like to dance '' , she said , << then >> turned and walked away .
I closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy to pick up , << then >> went to the bathroom for a drink of water .
He consulted the parking ticket , << then >> looked at a notation and said , `` You're in the third row back toward the rear .
I waited until the parking attendant was busy with a customer , << then >> slipped around the back of the car with license number JYM 114 , attached the electronic bug to the rear bumper and walked out .
For the first fifteen or twenty minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window displays , << then >> in people passing by .
His signal was coming loud and clear and << then >> all of a sudden it turned to a buzz .
I took another sidelong glance at the other registration card , << then >> took the key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car .
the unknown was so much worse << than >> -- what dangers lay ahead for her ? ?
And Jarrodsville was more << than >> three miles away , down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire .
And << then >> the station wagon and the Ford would seek him out again .
And << then >> he heard them .
And << then >> he heard a car coming from the east , and he felt as if he would break down and weep .
He listened a moment and << then >> said , `` Hold it '' .
Not more << than >> a block or so '' .
Shayne noted idly that it carried Miami Beach license plates as he approached , and << then >> saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they passed , indicating that it was occupied .
On this side of the Bay , Miami Beach cops had no more legal rights << than >> any ordinary citizen , and Shayne's pistol permit was just as good as theirs .
Shayne stepped back to let him slump to the ground , and << then >> dived over him through the open door into Harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster , somewhat impeded by the steering wheel .
He got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the top , sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men , and << then >> tossed the open bottle in on the front seat .
He turned , << then >> , to look toward the lighted Boulevard , and saw Rourke's tall , emaciated figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the street toward the opposite side .
By a wrenching effort , he managed to hunch and draw in , to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather << than >> his head .
He made himself back off slowly , his eyes wary on Roberts , who now had no more to lose << than >> he .
Mickey backed off again and Roberts hesitated , << then >> came along .
It moved in a silver arc toward his throat , << then >> veered downward .
He got a knee up into Roberts' belly , used both hands and heaved him clear , << then >> scrambled to his feet .
He fell on his side across the lowest step , rolled over once , << then >> lay still .
if not yet , << then >> soon , very soon .
Actually it was no more << than >> eight or ten minutes , and the sum of his reasoning came to this :
The local law here would hold me till they check clear back home , and maybe more << than >> that .
By << then >> they could never catch up with the others .
The body was heavier << than >> he had anticipated .
He dumped it into the back and made sure it wouldn't roll out , << then >> returned to the porch and closed the front door , making sure it was unlocked .
He stood looking down for a few seconds , << then >> backed up two or three paces from the edge .
It landed on Roberts' sprawled right thigh , poised precariously , << then >> slid off to the ground .
Jeb cautioned him not to be too hopeful and << then >> , ignoring his own advice , said excitedly , `` But it does sound good .
Gulf Springs was ten miles inland -- more of a quaint old coast town << than >> those along the beach made garish by tourist attractions .
Hirey treats himself a lot better << than >> we do prisoners .
It told him little more << than >> Mrs. Calhoun had remembered , stating that it had been a small , modest wedding compared to some of the others .
Two weeks , a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that , << then >> we make a little deal , isn't it '' ? ?
To be Katharine Ross , and work in a nicer shop somewhere , at a little more money so she could have prettier clothes , and learn ladies' manners and all like that , and get to know different people << than >> up to now , not just the ones like her here , with foreign-sounding names , the ones went to the same church and -- Different place , different job , different people , she'd be all different too .
-- What << then >> '' ? ?
But << then >> the so-called coffee was bad enough at best , cold it was all but undrinkable -- especially that cup ! !
So somebody else could have come in , too -- << then >> or later while she was out of the room .
And in all likelihood , by now , there was more << than >> one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage contract .
`` Well , << then >> who brought it '' ? ?
The doorman began to nod his head automatically , << then >> remembered who Gilborn was , what had happened to him the night before .
There was no evidence that anything was different << than >> it had been .
She had assumed before << then >> that one day he would ask her to marry him .
And << then >> , unexpectedly , Stanley made his announcement .
Kitti was thirty years younger << than >> Stanley , taller than Stanley , prettier than Stanley had any right to hope for , much less expect .
Kitti was thirty years younger than Stanley , taller << than >> Stanley , prettier than Stanley had any right to hope for , much less expect .

By the time Felix turned up it was early afternoon , which , one would think , would be late enough so that by << then >> , except for small children and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up , it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats .
You still have your paper hat and you're wearing it , but << then >> , it is an extraordinary paper hat and , in addition to anything else you may be , you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame out in the back yard .
It's not too much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats << than >> will Mr. Average Citizen .
Even << then >> , as you go into the house oppressed by the knowledge that something is cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable , official control , could you go on forgetting that you still had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish horn in your hand ? ?
This was a broth of a boy , our Felix , and nothing was more obvious << than >> the joy he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full of juice and spirit .
any kind of job was better << than >> brooding .
`` No longer << than >> yours .
Thornburg added in a lower voice but Andy overheard , `` They act more like a jury << than >> an audience '' .
He sensed rather << than >> heard the gasp that swept across the audience .
Someone clapped tentatively << then >> quickly stopped .
Thornburg knew , better << than >> any of them , that a public image was as fragile as Humpty Dumpty .
His son watched until he got as far as the hall , almost out of sight , << then >> hurried after .
`` The trouble with you '' , old man Arthur began , and << then >> checked himself .
She smoothed the skirt , sat down , << then >> stood up and went back to the windows .
I'd think that you even more << than >> I would be wondering what they're up to .
He had to cough << then >> ; ;
When he turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and << then >> rose toward home , he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minutes , sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear them of tears .
A second scene flashed before his mind , the interior of the garage at the new house and the young Bartlett girl turning startled to meet him , the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and << then >> the brightness as Mae had clicked on the light .
He came to a stretch of old orange groves , the trees dead , some of them uprooted , and << then >> there was an outlying shopping area , and tract houses .
And << then >> you wiped up some grease '' .
You used to paint in them , and << then >> you just took them for rags .
The King Arthur was less expensive << than >> the Dumont .
The King Arthur had fifty-four overnighters , again counting rooms rather << than >> people .
Only those actually with Payne when he was shot , or who had left the party within not more << than >> five minutes ( make five arbitrary ) positively had none .
Intangibles entered , << then >> -- hunches which felt like facts .
Willings was , presumably , a better << than >> average shot .
Because , if for no other reason , Willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger , tougher , << than >> anything else that went on two legs .
that what he had said was no more << than >> one of those things one does say , lightly , meaning nothing .
He was also , if Pam North was right , a closer acquaintance of Lauren Payne's << than >> she , now , was inclined to admit .
Had that tall dark boy , carrying trays too heavy for him , found what he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more << than >> he could bear ? ?
He scooped up the receiver and said , `` Police chief '' , into the mouthpiece , and << then >> , `` Oh yes , Mr. Benson .
No one the Medfield police had questioned professed to know any more about him << than >> about Johnston .
Garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair , which would not , he said more << than >> once , have ever come about if Mrs. Meeker had only seen fit to consult Mr. Hohlbein or him about it .
Mahzeer would direct the prime minister's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and << then >> step to one side .
He paused on the landing to steady his breathing and << then >> bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead .
He had thought no further << than >> finding Muller .
He realized now he had more << than >> half hoped he wouldn't find him -- that Muller would not be here , that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond Hoag's control .
The lieutenant eyed Gun's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and << then >> glanced back at his own face , moving the comb methodically around his head .
`` Sir , Vaughn knows better << than >> to leave the station without a relief .
He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and << then >> , eying the report as it lay before him on the desk , intoned , `` Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide Detail of the Inspector's Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain O. T. Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six '' -- he leaned back and peeled off his glasses `` -- failed to co-operate with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordered .
At the doorway he squinted up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes , remembering << then >> that he'd left them at the Doughnuttery .
Since << then >> he had worked at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling .
Casey kept his smile fixed , but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about Needham , who was eight or ten years older << than >> the girl .
She made a face at him and << then >> she laughed .
Casey watched them go , still frowning absently and << then >> dismissing the matter as he called for his check .
Only << then >> , when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem .
For he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and << then >> returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself .
When he was told that no one had seen Burton since << then >> , he thought of three other places that were possibilities .
Only << then >> did he decide he didn't want one .
Casey heard the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth , and it took him no more << than >> three seconds to make his decision .
He was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less << than >> two minutes , and it took him only three more to reach the corner , a block from Columbus Avenue .
Slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more << than >> a crawl , and watched Elaine rapidly spin from one station to another , tune in the null , then draw in a line on the chart .
Slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl , and watched Elaine rapidly spin from one station to another , tune in the null , << then >> draw in a line on the chart .
`` Reverse '' , Elaine said , << then >> peered through the loop of the RDF and waved to Poet .
There should be an excited conversation , for somewhere , directly below them , was a treasure lost for more << than >> four hundred years .
Now , at this moment , there should be none unless skin diving was much more dangerous << than >> he had been led to believe .
She threw back a cushion over one of the seats , unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it , << then >> presently straightened , holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear gun in her hand .
A moment later , moving awkwardly because of the swimming fins , she picked up the gun , handed the knife to Poet , << then >> rolled off the transom of the boat , back first .
Pulling off her face mask , she carefully placed the spear gun across the stern , << then >> lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water .
He tossed her a towel , << then >> repeated the service for Poet .
And << then >> Nick knew that all of them knew Elaine , himself and Poet .
`` It's like banging a shin '' , he said , his eyes lingered on Nick's face , << then >> moved back to Elaine .
`` Hurts like hell for a second , << then >> it disappears '' .
The rubber and glass face mask slipped from Poet's forehead , bounced painlessly off Nick's chin , << then >> disappeared .
Instinctively he exhaled through his nose << then >> sucked in the air from the hose .
And << then >> rushed out of the house .
We walked up Main Street to this big white house , << then >> around to the back .
But << then >> I wasn't her social secretary '' .
For another moment we didn't talk , << then >> she began to weep .
In less << than >> five minutes Alec was asleep .
You want from me the story , but a story is about ' why ' and << then >> , perhaps , about how .
When you hold the spirit of a thing , << then >> somehow you know the truth -- you know a fake antique from the real thing .
Any more << than >> they have the sense to eat mussels .
Maybe it would be better to humor the guy and << then >> make an exit .
