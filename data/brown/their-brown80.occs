But << there >> is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to recall .
The ball lay << there >> , shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while Ruth , red-necked with frustration , charged about the small patch of ground screaming , `` Where's the -- -ing ball '' ? ?
Promoters always hastened to place << their >> choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators , and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance .
Radio broadcasts , however -- now that even plain people could afford `` loud speakers '' on << their >> sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones , chiefly women , who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition , became first inured , then attracted , then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park .
In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced , and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how << their >> heroes were faring .
Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands , where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling << their >> ears .

Erikson has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time ambivalence experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all adolescents ( as a result of << their >> remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion .

On the other hand , some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age , and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative , that << their >> work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior .
Erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves << their >> search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood .
It provides identification -- with an idea , a value , a cause that cuts through , or even transcends , the multiple and ambivalent identities of << their >> passage from child to adult , and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion .

But since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice , and since , in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for , the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present , << there >> has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force .

Those three other great activities of the Persians , the bath , the teahouse , and the zur khaneh ( the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics , dance , chanted poetry , and music ) , do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold , but some of them occupy splendid examples of Persian domestic architecture : long , domed , chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile , << their >> end walls cut through to the orchards and the sky by open arches .
But more important , and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see , is that these places and activities are often the settings in which Persians exercise << their >> extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities .

To a stranger << their >> delight in these things may seem paradoxical , for Persians chase the golden calf as much as any people .

The 140,414 Americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion '' to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of << their >> people .

Yet though the Southern States lost the worst errors in << their >> case , they did not lose the truth they fought for .
The lives so many of them gave , to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the Union on the powers reserved to << their >> states have continued ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom's other foe .

Seeing << their >> hesitation , I said , `` Well , until I have permission to enter Germany , or a visa to re-enter France , I shall be obliged to remain here on the line between two countries '' , whereupon I moved to the side of the road , parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on the sidewalk , sat down , took out my typewriter , and began typing the above conversation .

Katherine was staying at a convent , and her mother felt that , as Thompson himself seems to have suggested , she might eventually stay << there >> .
It is difficult to say what Thompson expected would come of << their >> relationship , which had begun so soon after his emotions had been stirred by Maggie Brien , but when Katie wrote on April 11 , 1900 , to tell him that she was to be married to the Rev. Godfrey Burr , the vicar of Rushall in Staffordshire , the news evidently helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure of his hopes for a new volume of verse .
Last , not least , << there >> are some poems which K. King sent me ( addressed to herself ) when I was preparing a fresh volume , asking me to include them .

When they were first written , << there >> was evidently no thought of their being published , and those which refer to the writer's love for Mrs. Meynell particularly have the ring of truth .

Taking into account Thompson's capacity for self-dramatization and the possibility of a wish to identify his own life with the misfortunes of other poets who had known unhappy loves , << there >> can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for Katie King .
If , as Reid says , `` nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not taking opium '' , << there >> may be some reason to doubt that he was under its influence in the period from 1896 to 1900 when he was writing the poems to Katie King and making plans for another book of verse .
Reviewing Davidson's The Testament Of An Empire Builder , for example , Thompson found that << there >> was `` too much metrical dialectic '' .

To Serenissimus such tribes as the Cossacks of the Don or those ex-bandits the Zaporogian Cossacks ( in whose islands along the lower Dnieper the Polish novelist Sienkiewicz would one day place With Fire And Sword ) were just elements for enforced resettlement in , say , Bessarabia , where , as `` the faithful of the Black Sea borders '' , he could use << their >> presence as bargaining points in the Czarina's territorial claims against Turkey .

Plato is , at times , just as suspicious of the poets themselves as he is of << their >> work .
He wants them to use << their >> great power to strengthen man's rational side , to teach virtue , and to encourage religion .
for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers -- I mean , if << there >> is a use in poetry as well as a delight '' .
But << there >> are , however , several features of Aristotle's approach which open the way for the moral measure of literature .
And << there >> is one other point in the Poetics that invites moral evaluation : Aristotle's notion that the distinctive function of tragedy is to purge one's emotions by arousing pity and fear .
Both sides claimed that Plato and Aristotle supported << their >> cause .

From New Jersey , Morgan hastened to the headquarters of Washington at Whitemarsh , Pennsylvania , arriving << there >> on November 18th .
A picket guard of about 350 , mostly Hessians , were attacked by the Americans under Lafayette , and driven back to << their >> camp , some twenty to thirty of them falling before the riflemen's fire .
A body of redcoats were seen marching down a nearby slope , a tempting target for the riflemen , who threw a volley into << their >> ranks and `` messed up '' the smart formation considerably .
Now the riflemen and the Marylanders followed up << their >> beginning and closed in on the British , giving them another telling round of fire .
But you could ( as from yourself ) tell her that you had friends who , being with the army , don't know what to do with << their >> money and would willingly let her have one or many thousand dollars '' .
Besides helping to prevent the movement of the British to the west , Valley Forge also obstructed the trade between Howe's forces and the farmers , thus threatening the vital subsistence of the redcoats and rendering << their >> foraging to obtain necessary supplies extremely hazardous .
The headquarters of Morgan was on a farm , said to have been particularly well located so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the British , a practice all too common to those who preferred to sell << their >> produce for British gold rather than the virtually worthless Continental currency .
If << there >> be a disinterested patriot in America , 'tis General Washington , and his bravery , none can question '' .
The troops must have more than the common quantity of liquor , and perhaps << there >> will be some little drunkenness among them '' .
Morgan took the suggested steps , but when Mrs. Sanderson appeared , << there >> was nobody with her but her husband , whom he promptly sent to headquarters to be questioned .

Nogaret is hardly an impartial witness , and even he did not make his charges against Boniface until the latter was dead , but << there >> is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say .
When the negotiations began , his quarrel with the king of France was temporarily in abeyance , and he had no intention of reviving it so long as << there >> was hope that French money would come to pay the troops who , under Charles of Valois , the papal vicar of Tuscany , were so valuable in the crusade against the Colonna cardinals and their Sicilian allies .

He was unable to send any more help to his allies on the Continent , and during the next few years many of them , left to resist French pressure unaided , surrendered to the inevitable and made << their >> peace with Philip .
But although in many of these discussions Othon and Amadee might have been tempted to consider << their >> own interests as well as those of the king , Edward's confidence in them was so absolute that they were made the acknowledged leaders of the embassy .
Underneath all the high-sounding phrases of royal and papal letters and behind the more down-to-earth instructions to the envoys was the inescapable fact that Edward would have to desert his Flemish allies and leave them to the vengeance of << their >> indignant suzerain , the king of France , in return for being given an equally free hand with the insubordinate Scots .
These chatty merchants made amusing and instructive traveling companions , for << their >> business took them to all four corners of the globe , and Florentine gossip had already reached a high stage of development as even a cursory glance at the Inferno will prove .

Without a precise knowledge of Germanic philology , however , it is debatable whether << their >> use was not more often a source of confusion and error than anything else .
Even in the nineteenth century such accomplished philologists as Kemble and Guest were led into what now seem ludicrous errors because of << their >> failure to recognize that modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical philological development .
In sum , it can be said that the techniques and standards of present day have << their >> origin at the turn of the century .
It was Plummer , in fact , who coined the much quoted remark : `` Mr. Green indeed writes as if he had been present at the landing of the Saxons and had watched every step of << their >> subsequent progress '' .
For it is << their >> catastrophic concept of the Anglo-Saxon invasions rather than Kemble's gradualist approach which dominates the field .
Largely due to << their >> efforts the catastrophic invasion-theory has maintained its position although Seebohm has always found supporters .

Again omitting recent developments , E.T. Leeds' dictum of 1913 has stood unchallenged : `` So far as archaeology is concerned , << there >> is not the least warrant for the second ( shore occupied by ) of these theories '' .
That is , << there >> was no trace of Anglo-Saxons in Britain as early as the late third century , to which time the archaeological evidence for the erection of the Saxon Shore forts was beginning to point .
My argument is that << there >> was no Saxon Shore prior to that time even though the forts had been in existence since the time of Carausius .
Therefore , what we must prove or disprove is that << there >> were Saxons , in the broad sense in which we must construe the word , in the area of the Saxon Shore at the time it was called the Saxon Shore .
In Gaul the Saxon element on its Saxon Shore was plainly visible because << there >> the Saxons were an intrusive element in the population .
namely , is the idea that << there >> were Saxon mercenaries in England at all reasonable ? ?
To do so , something was necessary beyond volunteering because << there >> was little glamour or romance in the European war ; ;

After a dinner party for which she had come down to New York , Mrs. Lewis and Casanova arrived to see them off , and Elinor Wylie made tart observations that indicated that Lewis had been less discreet than he had promised to be about the real nature of << their >> separation .
As they stood at the first-class rail , waving down to his wife and Casanova below , Lewis said , `` Earl , << there >> is Gracie's future husband '' .

Considering then the optimism which has permeated science fiction for so long , what is really remarkable is that during the last twelve years many science-fiction writers have turned about and attacked << their >> own cherished vision of the future , have attacked the Childhood's End kind of faith that science and technology will inevitably better the human condition .

There is , of course , nothing new about dystopias , for they belong to a literary tradition which , including also the closely related satiric utopias , stretches from at least as far back as the eighteenth century and Swift's Gulliver's Travels to the twentieth century and Zamiatin's We , Capek's War With The Newts , Huxley's Brave New World , E. M. Forster's `` The Machine Stops '' , C. S. Lewis's That Hideous Strength , and Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four , and which in science fiction is represented before the present deluge as early as Wells's trilogy , The Time Machine , `` A Story Of The Days To Come '' , and When The Sleeper Wakes , and as recently as Jack Williamson's `` With Folded Hands '' ( 1947 ) , the classic story of men replaced by << their >> own robots .
In addition , << there >> are many areas of the human situation besides the impact of science and technology which are examined , for science-fiction dystopias often extrapolate political , social , economic tendencies only indirectly related to science and technology .
As the hero , Mitchell Courtenay , explains before his conversion , the job of advertising is `` to convince people without letting them know that << they're >> being convinced '' .
And the second requirement for convincing people without << their >> knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which persuade by using the principles which the scientists have discovered .
Now the basic question to be asked in this situation is what motivates the manipulators , that is , what are << their >> values ? ?

That fact is very clearly illustrated in the case of the many present-day intellectuals who were Communists or near-Communists in << their >> youth and are now so extremely conservative ( or reactionary , as many would say ) that they can define no important political conviction that does not seem so far from even a centrist position as to make the distinction between Mr. Nixon and Mr. Khrushchev for them hardly worth noting .

These biographical analogies are obvious , and far too much time has been spent speculating on << their >> possible implications .
For as his companions gradually dissolve back into a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity , as they lose all the appanage of << their >> acquired culture , he is overcome by the feeling that he is at last being confronted with the essence of mankind .

What is required is the full implementation of Article 2 of the Treaty , which provides : `` The Parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening << their >> free institutions , by bringing about a better understanding of the principles upon which these institutions are founded , and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being .
They will seek to eliminate conflict in << their >> international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any and all of them '' .
The problem of NATO is not one of machinery , of which << there >> is an abundance , but of the will to use it .
Conceived as an organ of economic cooperation , << there >> is no reason why O.E.C.D. cannot evolve into a broader instrument of union if its members so desire .
In a recent book called `` World Peace Through World Law '' , two distinguished lawyers , Grenville Clark and Louis Sohn , call for just such an overhaul of the U.N. , basing << their >> case on the world-wide fear of a nuclear holocaust .
The defect of these proposals is in << their >> attempt to outrun history and their assumption that because something may be desirable it is also possible .

Generally , however , << there >> is an abundance of available machinery of coordination -- in NATO , in O.E.C.D. , in the U.N. and elsewhere .

<< their >> reading and thinking gave an extension to their normal blushes about appearing ' Jewish ' in subway , bus , racetrack , movie house , any of the public places that used to make the Jew of my generation self-conscious ( heavy thinkers walking across Seventh Avenue without their glasses on , willing to dare the trucks as long as they didn't look like the ikey-kikey caricature of the Yiddish intellectual ) .

Around that statue in the green park where children play and lovers walk in twos and << there >> is a glowing view of the whole city , in that park are the rows of marble busts of Garibaldi's fallen men , the ones who one day rushed out of the Porta San Pancrazio and , under fire all the way , up the long , straight narrow lane to take , then lose the high ground of the Villa Doria Pamphili .
For one thing , << there >> wasn't going to be any ceremony at all this year .

But << there >> will be still other countries where , despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help , we shall deem it wise , for political or military reasons , to give substantial economic assistance .
In several significant cases , such as India , a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward << their >> own economic and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance .
The number of countries thus favorably situated is small , but << their >> peoples constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world .
In still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity , the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing << their >> human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible .

More importantly , several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan << their >> own complex investment programs for at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence .

Is << there >> objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts ? ?
It is notably significant that so many Members from both sides of the aisle express << their >> respect and admiration for our beloved Speaker , the Honorable Sam Rayburn .
For what Sam Rayburn's life in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and << there >> is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district .
It is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at << their >> homes .
At that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish << their >> duties .
Whether << there >> were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical .
( Note : So far as State Police cars are concerned , only << their >> replacement is under this division ) .
There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support << their >> own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well .
Thus , << there >> has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and , in addition , must give assistance to its local governments .
This financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax , or at least at the rates then existing , insufficient for << their >> requirements .
Consequently << there >> have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes , as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level .
Notwithstanding state aid , the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of << their >> own by strengthening the property tax .
These opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what << their >> thinking seems to be at the present time .
So few answered the question relating to << their >> efforts to assess movable property that the results are inconclusive .
It is not clear , however , whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats , trailers , aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be advantageous to << their >> particular towns .
To summarize , it may be said that << there >> is no one prevailing practice in Rhode Island with respect to the taxation of movable property , that assessors would like to see an improvement , and of those who have an opinion , that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge .

The need for greater knowledge is evident from << their >> replies .
Through << their >> professional organization , the Rhode Island Tax Officials Association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed .
No one really knows how many boats << there >> actually are or what their aggregate value may be .

Leading firms that arranged << their >> own financing included Speidel Corporation , Cornell-Dubilier , Photek , Inc. Division of Textron , Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry , W. R. Cobb Company , and Mays Manufacturing Company .
These objectives are stated here because of << their >> importance in understanding the current activities of the Planning Division .
To this end , the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available , on a shared cost basis , technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain << their >> own planning staff .
In eight states whose fiscal years close on June 30 , a majority of << their >> cities close their fiscal year on December 31 : :
In eight states whose fiscal years close on June 30 , a majority of their cities close << their >> fiscal year on December 31 : :
Mississippi closes its fiscal year on June 30 , while all of its cities close << their >> fiscal years on September 30 .
All of its cities close << their >> fiscal years on December 31 .
It should be noted that << there >> are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year .
Fortunately , << there >> are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change .
Six cities and towns are presently on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated << their >> tax collection year with it .
This change will automatically adjust << their >> tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year .
Six cities and towns are now on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust << their >> tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity .
In that both cities end << their >> fiscal years on September 30 , they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months , commencing with September 30 and ending with June 30 .
Aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars , << there >> is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary .
In many communities << there >> is simply no financial problem ; ;
In addition , no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to << their >> over-all financial condition .
For those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments , << there >> are a number of alternatives any one of which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if not even eliminate the problem .
Proceeds realized from these pageants are used by the Jaycees to help support << their >> various youth , health , welfare and community betterment activities throughout the state .
and now , therefore , do I , John A.

The Pilgrims gathered to thank the Lord for His benevolence during << their >> first year in the new land .

Upon such sale , << there >> shall be returned to any State or public agency which has contributed financial assistance under Section 3 of this joint resolution a proper share of the net proceeds of the sale .
Subject to the limitations of this Act , the Secretary shall make stabilization payments to small domestic producers upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to him of << their >> status as such producers and of the sale by them of newly mined ores , or concentrates produced therefrom , as provided in this Act .
During fiscal years 1959 and 1960 , << there >> were 139 military and civilian students who came to the Institute for varying periods of special instruction .

Then , abandoning the studies in the face of << their >> promising outlook for all concerned , B. & O. entered on-again-off-again negotiations with C. & O. which resulted in the present situation .

My heartiest congratulations go to << their >> successors , Orvil E. Dryfoos and John B. Oakes , who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New York Times .
The people of the 17th District of New York , and I as << their >> Representative in Congress , take great pride in the New York Times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world .
Cuban S.S.R. : Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro-held mainland last week , << there >> was at least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian-dominated military base .
But the Latin American republics who have been rather inclined to drag << their >> feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board .
It stipulates , in addition , that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below << their >> maximums .
For the States which maintain two separate agencies -- one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the blind -- the Act specifies that << their >> minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal year 1954 .
Funds allotted in addition to << their >> minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine .

Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in << their >> incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation .
Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between Du Pont and General Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised << their >> business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies .

While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins' pronouncement in Pleas Of The Crown from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that << their >> actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage .

We said << there >> that it was necessary `` that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut ( the Department's ) recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification '' .
As was said in Gonzales , `` it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be overturned unless << there >> is no basis in fact .
But << there >> is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant .
While << there >> are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process .
There we held `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective service system , entitles [ conscientious objectors ] to no guarantee that the FBI reports must be produced for << their >> inspection '' .
If << there >> is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs .
I tried to do so by calling to << their >> attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces .
His first thought is about the question itself : Is << there >> a question here for American foreign policy , and , if so , what is it ? ?
What the American people will do turns in large degree on << their >> leadership .
While << there >> should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex , there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women .
While there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex , << there >> will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women .
Nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what << their >> counterparts abroad are paid .
Wherever possible they should live with << their >> host country counterparts .
For readjustment to the U.S. , volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of << their >> overseas service , based on the length of time served .
The Peace Corps , therefore , offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world -- an opportunity for the American people to think anew and start afresh in << their >> participation in world development .
In the first year << there >> should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects .
Unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything in << their >> power to promote active hostility .
But << there >> are indications that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers , and that if the volunteers are well chosen , they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends .
But there are indications that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers , and that if the volunteers are well chosen , they will soon demonstrate << their >> value and make many friends .
No matter how well conceived and efficiently run , << there >> probably will be failures .
With colleges and universities carrying a large part of the program , and with students looking toward Peace Corps service , << there >> will be an impact on educational curriculum and student seriousness .
I recommend to the Congress the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps -- a pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet << their >> urgent needs for skilled manpower .
Throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects << their >> deepest desires .
These destructive forces also have a seriously adverse effect upon the watersheds and << their >> life-supporting waterflows , and upon the other renewable forest resources .
In the forest highway system , << there >> are now 24,400 miles of public roads .
Furthermore , roads that give access to National Forest timber are investments which pay << their >> own way over a period of years .
Within exterior boundaries of National Forests and National Grasslands , << there >> are about 40,000,000 acres in non-Federal ownership .
If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , << their >> basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing character and missions of the active forces .
I again proposed a reduction in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve -- from << their >> present strengths of 400,000 and 300,000 , respectively , to 360,000 and 270,000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961 .
Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time << their >> development was commenced have since been completely eliminated .
By 1965 , several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and << their >> reliability established .
In carrying out this Agreement , the two Governments will seek to assure , to the extent practicable , conditions of commerce permitting private traders to function effectively and will use << their >> best endeavors to develop and extend continuous market demand for agricultural commodities .
The extent of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal , or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors , among the principal ones being the distance between the stations , << their >> respective radiated power , and , of particular significance here , the time of day .
It was recognized that skywave signals , because of << their >> reflected nature , are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength .
Since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number , these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized , and to the extent that each is realized , << there >> is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others .
The class 1 , stations on these clear channels are protected to << their >> 0.1-mv./m. groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference .
class 1 , -- B stations are protected at night to << their >> 0.5-mv./m. 50-percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference .
Additional class 2 , assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 , stations or to each other , and by << their >> operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities .
Since then , << there >> has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it , leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena .

For the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good : such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected , by records made subsequent to << their >> selection over considerable periods of time .
Their locations in all parts of the United States , and << their >> locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are factors in the Trustees' minds .
For this concept of an Advisory Board , ancillary to the Board of Trustees , we are indebted to the late President of Harvard University , A. Lawrence Lowell , a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and << their >> administration .
For example , the interest of past members of the Foundation's Advisory Board remains such that they place << their >> knowledge and judgments at our disposal much as they had done when they were , formally , members of that Board .
And , besides , << there >> are a large number of scholars , artists , composers of music , novelists , poets , essayists , choreographers , lawyers , servants of government , and men of affairs -- hundreds , indeed -- who serve the Foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis out of their experience .

For , granting that << there >> are great present-day problems to be solved , these problems make great demands ; ;
That is , to put it realistically , they had to run << their >> businesses at a profit , or they had to get the votes to get elected .
And the reason this could happen is clear : men of government , business men , lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of << their >> fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity .

And lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report , let me enlighten them with the truths that , under Communism << there >> would have been no capital with which to endow the Foundation , and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed , untrammeled in every way , toward their discoveries , their creative efforts for the good of mankind .

In 1838 , a devastating fire gutted << their >> small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west to Illinois , settling on a land grant in his declining years .
By 1853 , the new partnership announced the precision vernier caliper as the first fruit of << their >> joint efforts .
Throughout << their >> careers , both Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades .
Following Mr. Brown's death , << there >> came forward in the Brown & Sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company .
He was an ardent champion of the Brown & Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed << their >> industrial talents with the company .
In addition to the many appearances of these organizations throughout the college year , << there >> are concerts by students of the music department , by members of the music faculty , and by visiting artists .
The Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. at Carleton are connected with the corresponding national organizations and carry out << their >> general purposes .
The Associations sponsor many traditional campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new friendships , to broaden << their >> interests , and to engage in worthwhile service projects .
A student organization , Bottega , is open to any student interested in increasing his understanding and appreciation of the graphic and ceramic arts in << their >> historical , technical , and productive contexts .
Throughout the year << there >> are social events , such as picnics , breakfast hikes , canoe trips , banquets , and indoor parties .
The outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present , but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up << their >> buying plans for durable goods .
Demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half , but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced << their >> own operating rates .

To avoid passing over quiet , unaggressive teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion , review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for advancement by << their >> departments .
No one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to << their >> specialties is quite different .

It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and << their >> atmospheres .
This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although << there >> is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence .
No attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of << their >> distances , small diameters , or low temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity .
They deduced from << their >> measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; ;
The radio emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when Burke and Franklin ( 1955 ) identified the origin of interference-like radio noise on << their >> records at about 15 meters wave length as emission from Jupiter .
These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of << their >> lower molecular weight .

A number of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the Af bond becomes symmetric when the Af bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 A , but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime << there >> have been no convincing reports of symmetric Af bonds .
If the Af bond is linear then << there >> are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheets ; ;
In the household market , << there >> are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ;
In addition , many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had << their >> genesis in trisodium orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products .
Even here << there >> is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity .
Although << there >> is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces .

In all cases << there >> was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination .
If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about Af of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than << their >> potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth .

The staminate willow catkins , then , provide << their >> visitors with both nectar and pollen ; ;
a marvelous arrangement , for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make << their >> beebread , a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed .
If you really insist on knowing << their >> names , an excellent book on the North American species is Bumblebees And Their Ways by O. E. Plath .

When the larvae hatch , they feed on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meals from << their >> mother .
Some members of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of << their >> hardworking relatives .

Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half << their >> final length .
Data on the former are scanty , but << there >> can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length .
For four of the six ( the anaconda and the amethystine python cannot be included for lack of data ) << there >> is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa constrictor being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the former stage .
There are few data on the boa constrictor , those for the anaconda are unconvincing , and << there >> is nothing at all on the amethystine python .
Results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations : about three years are required , << there >> being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required .
The following information on snakes varying greatly in size ( but all with less than a 10-foot maximum ) shows , when considered with the foregoing , that << there >> is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature .
In spite of all the pitfalls , << there >> is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants .
What data << there >> are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; ;
Theoretically , they are capable of extracting << their >> required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , '13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , '58 ) .
Nakamura ( '58 ) , Verloop ( '48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ( '50 ) , Von Hayek ( '53 ) , and Tobin ( '52 ) have all claimed << their >> normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being .
Certainly , the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny << their >> existence in that species .
This is especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be used , in view of << their >> marked anatomical differences from man .
Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , << there >> are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets .
The lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as << their >> Onset and Completion .
It is clear that << there >> are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement .
It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but << there >> is substantial agreement .
One growth center in a short bone -- distal phalanx of the second finger -- was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short bones , occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near << their >> comparable pubescent stage .
It seems clear , from the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that << there >> was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions for the 34 girls .
A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecasting << their >> attainment of the pubescent stage .
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and << there >> is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems .
Since the circulating thyroid hormones are the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine ( cf. Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for << their >> release from proteins before secretion .
There is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly purified form nor is << their >> specificity known .
A study of << their >> activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediates ( Alpers , Petermann and Rall , 1956 ) .
On the other hand , << there >> are a few antithyroid drugs of this same general type , such as resorcinol , possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine .
As long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by Niepce ( 1851 ) that << there >> is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid .
After << their >> work other investigators applied salt-fractionation techniques to the problem , as well as fractionation with organic solvents , such as acetone .
The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that << there >> exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 ) .
Chlorothiazide was omitted for a 2-week period , but << there >> was no change in the muscle weakness .
The coronary arteries were sclerotic and diffusely narrowed throughout << their >> courses , and the right coronary artery was virtually occluded by a yellow atheromatous plaque 1.5 cm. distal to its origin .
The intimal surface of the aorta was covered with confluent , yellow-brown , hard , friable plaques along its entire course , and << there >> was a marked narrowing of the orifices of the large major visceral arteries .
On the surfaces of both lungs << there >> were emphysematous blebs measuring up to 3 cm. in diameter .

Some of the small vessels were filled with fibrin thrombi , and << there >> was extensive interstitial hemorrhage .
On the surface of the right kidney << there >> were also 2 yellow , firm , friable raised areas measuring up to 2 cm. in diameter .
Microscopically , both kidneys showed many small cortical scars in which << there >> was glomerular and interstitial fibrosis , tubular atrophy , and an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells .
Throughout , << there >> were marked arteriolosclerosis and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arterioles .
In addition , << there >> were 2 small papillary adenomas in the right kidney .
Microscopically , << there >> were many areas of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity .
The cells of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic series were normal except for << their >> numbers .
In the gastrocnemius and biceps << there >> were many swollen and homogeneous necrotic fibers such as that shown in Figure 2 .
In association with these changes in the fibers , << there >> were striking alterations in the muscle nuclei .
Occasionally << there >> were small basophilic fibers that were devoid of myofibrillae and contained many vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli ( Fig. 5 ) .
Frequently a few isolated thick-walled cells or , rarely , groups of such cells in the xylem region , were also specifically stained , but << there >> was no such staining in epidermis , cortex , most xylem cells , ray cells , or pith .
Although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , << there >> is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance .
In our attempt to interpret the emotions in << their >> physiological and pathological range , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems , respectively .

Second , even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely over F into a product of polynomials of degree 1 , << there >> may not be enough characteristic vectors for T to span the space V .
Thus << there >> are polynomials Af such that Af .
We say that N is nilpotent if << there >> is some positive integer R such that Af .
Then << there >> is a diagonalizable operator D on V and a nilpotent operator N in V such that ( A ) Af , ( b ) Af .
If T is a linear operator on an arbitrary vector space and if << there >> is a monic polynomial P such that Af , then parts ( A ) and ( B ) of Theorem 12 are valid for T with the proof which we gave .
Note that << there >> are 3 trials of interest .
Sometimes when << there >> are many outcomes for a single trial , we group these outcomes into two classes , as in the example of the die , where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes `` ace '' and `` not-ace '' .
The number of successes on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0 or 1 , and << there >> are 5 such random variables here .
This theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that << there >> exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in Af .
To each paired vertex and diagonal point << there >> corresponds a unique forward corner point , i.e. , the corner on C reached first by proceeding along C from the vertex in the direction of increasing T .
Thus if E is sufficiently small , << there >> can be only one intersection of C and Af near Q , for if there were more than one intersection for every E then the difference between C and Af near Q would not be a monotone function .
Thus if E is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of C and Af near Q , for if << there >> were more than one intersection for every E then the difference between C and Af near Q would not be a monotone function .
The fact that << there >> can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and Af are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point .
( C ) Af cuts across C and << there >> are two ordinary intersections for every T in Af .
We must now show that on some component of the graph << there >> exist two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the C-plane are on opposite sides of C .
A final class of exceptional lines is identifiable from the following considerations : Since no two generators of Af can intersect , it follows that << their >> image curves can have no free intersections .
The preceding observations make it clear that << there >> exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1 with no complex of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve Aj .
On C << there >> is a Af correspondence in which the Af points cut from C by a general line , l , of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection of the image of L and the plane of the pencil .
Moreover , in this involution << there >> is a cone of invariant lines of order Af , namely the cone of secants of **zg which pass through P .
the second requires that << there >> be a line through P which meets **zg in Af points .
However , if << there >> is no additional complex of singular lines , the order of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely Af .

While << there >> are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention , the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings all point up the importance of an immediate response to the client's initial need for help .

Since the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment , nor , as a matter of fact , in those who were continuing in `` single sections '' , he can only conclude that << there >> must have been something `` contagious '' within the specific group which caused this to occur .

It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like '' as reflecting << their >> hesitancy about taking chances .
One prediction had been made about the difference in security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted << their >> Kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not .
Among this latter group << there >> were also differences in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred .
Five subjects ( 12% ) did not change until they had been told that some people have something happen to << their >> arm , what that something was , and also were given a demonstration .
These subjects implied that they too could prevent << their >> arms from rising if they tried .
A differential suggestibility would have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute << their >> naive Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion .
Autosuggestibility , the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own expectations of the outcome ( i.e. , that the arm-rise is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction , because of his knowledge that `` to every reaction << there >> is an equal and opposite reaction '' ) also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the subjects' apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose , and ( 2 ) manifestations of the phenomenon despite anticipations of something else happening ( e.g. , of becoming dizzy and maybe falling , an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one of the subjects ) .

There was no implication made that << their >> initial reaction ( absence of an arm-elevation ) was less preferred than the presence of levitation .

The parent was asked to describe the child's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which << there >> was an opportunity to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self and others , irrational conformity to rules , orderliness , punctuality , and need for certainty .
Children scoring high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations where << there >> was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations , or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals .
The hypothesis of << there >> being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported , in this case , at the level .
Indeed << their >> achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant .
Possibly << their >> compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure .

Earlier , this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though << there >> were several different persons in the room , as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice .
Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in << their >> communicative expression , to some comparatively simple-seeming verbal or nonverbal statement .
But it is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that << there >> are at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another .
Freeman , Cameron and McGhie , in << their >> description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation '' .
But first , we must define two terms so that << their >> meaning will be clearly understood : form -- any unique sequence of alphabetic characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space ; ;
In the tune to which this hymn is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables have and fy , ending << their >> lines , have twice the time any other syllables have .
Thus in a context in which << there >> has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is new , dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows here , but in a context in which there has been discussion of local weather but no mention of snow , dominant stress will probably be on snows .

In << there >> aren't many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young takes dominant stress away from its head people : the fact that the young creatures of interest are people seems rather obvious .
Where << there >> is comparison or contrast , dominant stresses normally operate to center attention .

The desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in << their >> last components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns of stress of Chinese and Japanese .
Here again , in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics , but much of the time << there >> is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context .
In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent to on Tuesday , << there >> will be strong stress on by in the spoken language ; ;
In the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , << there >> will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; ;

Even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems , both in << their >> general outlines and in many specific details .
Often , therefore , << there >> are a number of rules having the same effect , and commonly other sets of rules as well , having the opposite effect .
As a result , many people have been confirmed in << their >> conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion .

Yet after long and earnest discussion Stalin accepted the Curzon Line and even agreed voluntarily that << there >> should be digressions from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of Poland in some regions .
However , << there >> was no real question of the justice of creating a strong Poland , both industrially and agriculturally , and one unplagued by large minorities of Germans or Russians .
In other words , the Soviet Union was determined to create a Poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against Germany and so closely tied to Russia that << there >> would never be any question of her serving as a cordon sanitaire against the Soviets or posing as an independent , balancing power in between Russia and Germany .
In even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of Eastern Europe , where the upper classes had generally collaborated with the Nazis , even to the extent of sending millions of << their >> peasants into Russia as a part of Hitler's armies .
But at Yalta the conflicting expectations of East and West were merged into an agreement by the Big Three to assist all liberated countries in Europe `` to create democratic institutions of << their >> own choice '' .
Later it developed that the Soviets had a very different interpretation of democracy , which will be discussed later , and << their >> judgment never told them that the Big Three should unite in establishing democratic conditions , as we understand them , within their zone of influence .

All political interests supported electoral planning , although << there >> are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination .
Until the Charter of Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , << there >> were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes .
By this time << there >> is little doubt but what election plans were complete .
From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating << their >> results .
In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence , but in a system where << there >> is as yet no place for the less prominent .
Although the elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying << their >> candidates .
With multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state << their >> positions more clearly .
As the background discussion indicated << there >> were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer elections .
The greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain << their >> full allocation of outside funds .
Most skilled industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire << their >> skills outside of formal training institutions .
By 1960 << there >> were such schools in all but 4 states .
Few states make effective use of << their >> existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry .
The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of << their >> vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant .
The major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is << their >> focus on serving solely local job demands .
All the manuals for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the growth of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and << their >> content .
Furthermore , << there >> is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys .
There is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in << their >> programs , even though they must pay tuition , receive no subsistence payments , and are not guaranteed a job .
However , << there >> always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training .
A training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless << there >> is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community .
The very idea of << there >> being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement .
The very idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that << there >> is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement .

The advantages and disadvantages of these two types of charting , bar charting and point and figure charting , remain the subject of fairly good-natured litigation among << their >> respective professional advocates , with both methods enjoying in common , one irrevocable merit .
Even if we strip << their >> respective claims to the barest minimum , the `` odds '' still favor them both , for the trend in effect is always more likely to continue than to reverse .
The foregoing have been methods of charting prices , but now let us look at some of the other indices that are customarily charted , and which are looked to for << their >> forecasting abilities .
And along Chicago's West Jackson Boulevard , La Salle Street , and around the Merchandise Mart Plaza << there >> sit men who chart crop reports , who divide the number of reported lady-bugs by the number of reported green-bugs , and the number of hogs by the amount of corn .
All these things and countless more enter into << their >> calculations , and yet , the enchanting index remains non-forthcoming .
But whereas civilized men no longer pursue the fountain , they never abandoned << their >> pursuit of the enchanting index .
Odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to << their >> particular statistical recipe .
Strong hands differ from `` weak hands '' in that << their >> operations are the primary movers .

Certain badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that << there >> is something somehow unfair , dirty , or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay of competitive forces .
Diametric opposition must persist as to the future course of prices , if << there >> is to persist a market at all .
Mr. John Magee , whose work has been discussed in this chapter , was quoted in a New Yorker Magazine profile as saying : `` Of course , you have to remember it's a good thing for us chartists that << there >> aren't more of us .
If you got too many people investing by this method , << their >> operations would begin to affect stock prices , and thus throw the charts off .
During much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau , but << there >> have been persistent signs of slack in the economy .
At this time , however , << there >> are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction .
However , the monetary authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of << their >> actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow of gold , as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive liquidity in the economy , which would delay the effectiveness of monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle .
The principle of `` bills only '' , or `` bills preferably '' , seems so strongly accepted by the Federal Reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade the authorities to depart radically from it by extending << their >> open market purchases regularly into long-term Government securities .
However , to the extent that the monetary authorities , in << their >> effort to ease credit in the next several months , conduct their open market operations in longer-term Government bonds , they will certainly act to accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces .

This is an area in which << there >> is still a large backlog of demand .
As a strike continues , these parties increase << their >> pressure on the industry to reach an agreement .
The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership , and << there >> is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate .
In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled out in Part 2 , below , find it to << their >> advantage to allow the wage rise .
Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in << their >> political alignments with one another ; ;
But << there >> was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world .
States were free to enact , within broad , though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , << their >> own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law merchant , and to enact legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high seas .

A careful student has suggested that `` In any new revision ( of the Judicial Code ) the legislators would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should be limited to those matters in which << their >> expertise in federal law might be used , leaving to the state judiciaries the primary obligation of pronouncing state law '' .
In substance , said the Court , << there >> was no transfer of equitable title .

The questionnaire was designed to elicit three types of information : ( 1 ) the facts regarding certain characteristics of the respondents , including << their >> experience with , and interest in , securing defense business ; ;
Ten days after the questionnaires were mailed , follow-up airmail postcards were sent urging those companies which had not yet returned << their >> questionnaires to do so at once .

the student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals , struggling to meet << their >> developmental needs , and at the same time trying to learn the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which they hold membership .
During early childhood , children are more interested in the approval of << their >> parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children ; ;
girls , who are more mature than boys , frown upon the youthful antics of boys of << their >> own age .
By the time pupils reach the sixth grade , << their >> ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed ; ;
they exhibit a keen interest in social , political , and economic problems , but they frequently have vague and incorrect notions about the terms they use rather glibly in << their >> routine school work .

A hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where << there >> already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth .
If << there >> were more such cases , it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers favor their own social classes .

If this happens , << there >> may be some class conflict in the South , with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position .
The members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy , << their >> position being strongest in the universities .
One upward-mobile teacher may be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb , while another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with lower-class pupils because he knows << their >> disadvantages and deprivations at home , and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment .
Their own experience in the social system influences << their >> work and attitudes as teachers .
While this influence is a complex matter , depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his social-class experience , << there >> probably are some general statements about social-class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth .
Teachers who have been upward mobile probably see education as most valuable for << their >> students if it serves students as it has served them ; ;
But another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with << their >> own use of education as a means of social advancement .
They generally vote so as to serve << their >> own constituency , and if the constituency should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class , they might be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests in education .
Nevertheless , << their >> conclusions and recommendations cannot please everybody , and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view .
For instance , << there >> have been two Presidential Commissions on higher education since World War 2 .

Philosophic systems , by the very nature of << their >> completeness , are overthrown by rival systems .
But before discussing it , I should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated << their >> case .
In the only sense in which badness is involved at all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety , since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling , and that feeling is still << there >> .
If anyone asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all , we should say that it made all the difference in the world , that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back << there >> , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our assertion was in that case mistaken .

So far as I can see , << there >> is only one way out for the positivist .
And << there >> is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging to the pain itself .
It is as empty as the word `` Hurrah '' would be when << there >> was no enthusiasm behind it .

In << their >> place came local variations within the common style -- tentative , as it were , in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed .
The potters of the Aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland , and in Greece itself Argive , Corinthian , Attic , Boeotian , and other Geometric sequences have each << their >> own hallmarks .

In << their >> vases were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization , at first hesitantly in Protogeometric work , and then more confidently in the initial stages of the Geometric style .
Wavy lines , feather-like patterns , rosettes of indefinitely floral nature , birds either singly or in stylized rows , animals in solemn frieze bands ( see Plates 11 - 12 ) -- all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening << their >> gaze .
As the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of << their >> production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident .
General manager Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept << their >> offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished .

The Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party , who proclaim as one of << their >> cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' .

It was because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason -- that is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of depicted objects , or at least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque's and Picasso's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous << there >> -- but only as flattened silhouettes -- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 .

The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head , fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall -- << there >> was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster -- and I thought , Well you don't look much like a pig-drunk bully now .

A wave of flame rippling through << their >> cave had reached Nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing .
Because he couldn't hear them , he was more convinced they were << there >> .
Then << there >> was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .
Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine's reach and away from << their >> shadows .
It sounded as if the man were calling him : `` Hey , Japanese hey << there >> , Japanese '' .
Chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated << their >> tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar .
Led by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of << their >> guns .
They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in << their >> houses .
The two lawmen halted << their >> wagon about twenty yards from the door .
Charles said as they picked << their >> way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .
`` I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down << there >> by the quarry '' .
Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out << there >> with them , trying to get them inside .
`` Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up << their >> dress '' .
The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and << their >> disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds .
His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that << there >> was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .
His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to << their >> relationship than that of slave to owner .
Suddenly << there >> was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase .
When they had licked the last of the wieners' taste from << their >> fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette .
He advanced on them , and abruptly << there >> was a shocked electricity in the car .
Yet if he were not << there >> , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June ; ;
Or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when << their >> black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights .
) And his eyes -- those miniature sundials of variegated yellow -- had not altered << their >> expression or direction .
There seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat << there >> with his eyes glued to Drexel Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him .
And the coffee shop on Drexel Street , where the men spent << their >> evenings and Sundays playing cards , had a rose hedge beneath its window .
All the while she sat << there >> , her sinewy arms swirled before her chest .
Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and << there >> were dreams to dream about ? ?
He knew it was << there >> , knew also what it was about , but he wouldn't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog's back .
Maggie couldn't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : << there >> was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; ;
Mr. Clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's upkeep , and besides that << there >> were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap .
That kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created depressions with << their >> stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight rates .

it was the theme song of millions of American people , << their >> personal problems no less urgent than those of the government .
The pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to << their >> ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms .
`` It was plain as the nose on your face that << they're >> laughing about it , Mamma .
`` I'll decide that when I get << there >> .
What else was << there >> to say ? ?
But << there >> were great satisfactions , even for a small man .
For the first few months of << their >> marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny , going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall .
Never concern for his wife's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark << their >> own dear baby due in January .
There was something not nice about triplets , though << their >> father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted , saying , `` You don't see triplets trippin' down the pike ever' day , Miss Jen , hon .
But when Miss Jen went over right away to return the call , Miss Kiz couldn't have been very cordial , for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get << there >> .
<< there >> had been lessons in French from a small Polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; ;
<< there >> had been the dancing class -- Miss Craddock , thin and tireless , with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three , one-two-three .
She had always been able to ignore the moral question because << there >> had been no choice .
The birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all of Doaty's flowers in << their >> artificial blossom and leaf .
It had always seemed to rain << there >> , and even the grass was gray .
To a Blackwell , << there >> was only one church .
See half of 'em in << their >> graves before I choose my own coffin .
He straightened himself , soldierly against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in << their >> old boots .
`` You'd be the one to say '' , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different '' , since all actions had << their >> own laws .
He mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had << their >> wicked strength .
Henrietta looked down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on << their >> journey's way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , Folly dancing ahead of her .
They were covered with tiny white blossoms , << their >> scant roots clawing at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry .
She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of << their >> great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts .
The Momoyama family had come from Miyagi Prefecture , in the northeast of the main Japanese island of Honshu , where << there >> are still traces of the mysterious Ainu strain .
all << their >> men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful .
all their men were bearded , and many of << their >> women were beautiful .
A pitiful few of them are left now , to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing << their >> ancient tribal chants , which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the American Indians .
Tommy was interested in psychiatry , because << there >> was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients .
And she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back << there >> .
The trouble was that << there >> was no lasting satisfaction in this for Tommy .
There are Spanish girls who look like Tommy Momoyama , brunettes with a Moorish hint of the Orient in << their >> faces ; ;
<< there >> are beauties from the Balkan states who are similarly endowed , and -- back in the blessed United States -- they were regarded simply as pretty women .
the other was with her American husband and << their >> exceptionally appealing children .
But she was learning that so long as she was in this country , and wore civilian dress in the Club , << there >> would always be transient young men who would approach her with broken English .
And , still , they did not have to be so crude in << their >> approach .
`` I'll be << there >> , but I'll walk '' , Doc said .
Then << there >> was exercise , boating and hiking , which was not only good for you but also made you more virile : the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted .
When Owen was finally rid of him , << there >> was a timid rap at the door .
They're up << there >> in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them '' .
`` I don't know much about them '' , Owen admitted , `` but I suppose they have << their >> own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do '' .
The more canvassing I do , the more I note how far most people are from << their >> personal God '' .
`` Is << there >> any word you would like to offer in your own defense '' ? ?
Heiser , breathless and wild-eyed , brought the chilling news that the handspikes , heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from << their >> customary places .
He bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned << their >> heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction .
Then , with disappointment evident upon << their >> faces , they moved to the work .
Spencer's potential followers were openly sullen and morose , missing muster without excuse , expressing in ominous tones << their >> displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons , communicating with the three by glance and signal .
Then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the United States , they will be punished but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expected to perform << their >> jobs in good order .
One did one's best and if fortune smiled , << there >> was a reward .
The prisoners averted << their >> eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger .
I know nothing of any plot , if << there >> is such a thing '' .
There was good fortune and << there >> was bad and Philip Spencer , in handcuffs and ankle irons , knew it to be a truth .
`` Spencer , if << there >> is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent ? ?
`` And do you think << there >> is a reason why I should accept your word '' ? ?
No action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen , prior to << their >> knowing the significance of the Greek paper , had seen it in Cromwell's hands while Spencer whispered explanations .
This was a training ship and the training would continue , but << there >> was an element of frightful absurdity here which Alexander recognized .
The dirty , discolored buildings looked boarded up , and << their >> few windows stood high above our heads .
They had large bright eyes , the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere , and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing << their >> little white faces .
Since they did not glance curiously at us once , I guessed that << there >> was a penalty for distraction .
Your mother wanted to bring children to Israel so that they could leave << their >> ghettos .
If she could not take the children out of this section , at least she could take other children out of << their >> countries and put them on the farms .
Like Mattie and the mayor up << there >> gripping the microphone and Toonker Burkette back in his office yanking out teeth , like they all knew he would .
So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out << there >> in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help .
that he must have since he was << there >> like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him , that other guy .
The mayor envisioned factories << there >> .
You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up << there >> you were someone else and the world was something else too .
Back at the Factory-to-You with the other old maids , back << there >> she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four , which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions , like the unventilated toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down .
The toilet hadn't had a sincere scrubbing in years and << there >> were things written on the walls of the little boxed-in place because you couldn't keep the public out -- entirely .
And the hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on Saturdays and during sales , and << there >> were no chairs and you couldn't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or janitor .
And the hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on Saturdays and during sales , and there were no chairs and you couldn't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and << there >> was no porter or janitor .
and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place -- you've got six colors << there >> including gold '' .
Like certain expensive restaurants , just sitting << there >> gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself .
They sit alone in << their >> rooms and try to paint , and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life .
The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton's studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he didn't work << there >> himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning .
Actually , << there >> was a lot of force in him , which is why I kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week .
`` It narrows down down down and finally << there >> is no way out .
I made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so << there >> would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend .
With this movie-to-be in London , and new faces about her << there >> , she would soon be a more tranquil , a wiser person , all the better for her stay out here .
I did my shopping , had my dentist appointment , and from << there >> I went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed plans for the annual Christmas bazaar , so that dusk was beginning to gather when I drove home in the late afternoon .
Prisoners brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember , and reading the accounts of << their >> testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove , absent itself , unsee .
Dolly Engisch was waiting << there >> on the steps and she came running toward us .
And then I remembered a few years before after << their >> return from a short trip to Rome I had heard her boast , over and over again , `` On the boat people liked me for myself '' .
It's so romantic up << there >> , she used to say , with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night , so poetic .
It is absurd of course to say that that one exclamation estranged me from the family I considered my very own , but << there >> it hangs , a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other .
It is not << their >> avoidance that rankles ; ;
She no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of << their >> meeting that first night in Parioli .
And when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at Santa Maria he had to keep a straight face , not letting on he had been << there >> with Alberto .
He had never heard so many bells , and as he lay << there >> listening , he thought of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the Spanish Steps .
From the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that << there >> were certain things he could never know .
And they sat down and began << their >> little coffee party .
Elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited , the women peering from << their >> lodges then gathering in small , curious clusters .
Standing << there >> she saw Shades of Night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost imperious , her body taut , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of Walitzee waited , perhaps denying the dread that moved in her .
The other women had come close now , << their >> voices murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot , their threats mingling , rising , nagging at each other , each trying to make her indignation and anger felt .

He made the long whip sing and snap around << their >> heads so that they ran screaming , some tripping over themselves in their flight .
He made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming , some tripping over themselves in << their >> flight .
Now they moved , rubbing << their >> flesh alive again , disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them .
They came out and held << their >> games and races .
It was they who held the future in << their >> hands .
They danced the paxam wildly at night , the war dance , and dipped << their >> arrowheads in the venom of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers , firing their few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal .

They danced the paxam wildly at night , the war dance , and dipped their arrowheads in the venom of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers , firing << their >> few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal .
Walitzee was among them , and Sarpsis , and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of << their >> passing .
Yellow Wolf was << there >> , nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead , in whom also the disordered chemistries of youth worked .
They raced and maneuvered for war , swinging << their >> horses in single file and then abreast like cavalry .
At times they would ride frenziedly through the camp , letting the women see << their >> courage , how handsome they were in their regalia .

They would give one final testimony of << their >> challenge to let the people see their arrogance .
They would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see << their >> arrogance .
And so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young men's blood , shifting then into the full heat and outcry which ran with << their >> hearts .
They mounted << their >> horses and rode off into the hills .
Standing then with the others , peering into the sun , he saw the bright , multicolored legion , << their >> hair flying like dark banners , only the thunder , the roll of drums , the mad cacophony of the hoofs accompanying them .
They leaned into the wind and seemed like one thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose straight in << their >> saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted , ejaculated their grotesque cry of war .

and << there >> were his shoes , thank God , but his shirt was one terrible mess .
Yes , << there >> was the key .
`` You've got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine government job over << there >> -- she'll get a home for herself and Cathy in no time .
It seemed to Lucy that all << their >> married life , she and Jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life .
<< their >> talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm , as steeped in light , as the air around them .
their talk and << their >> feeling had been as deep and warm , as steeped in light , as the air around them .
And at this point , Lucy thought , << there >> should be a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls -- but she could sympathize with Susan ; ;
<< there >> ought to be a limit to sharing , too .
its mate must be at home , silently guarding << their >> nest .
When she picked up the receiver , her mother's cheerful voice was << there >> .
`` Well '' -- This time << there >> was a long silence , while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life .
Again << there >> was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` I guess I do .
Shocked speechless , Lucy sat << there >> .
As she hung up , she saw through the hall's open window the purple-black flying of the cowbirds' wings , and heard << their >> grotesque singing .
Lucy glancing at the miniature case , knew << there >> would not be enough in it for the shortest of stays ; ;
The wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades , and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down << there >> , bleeding , wedged between the rocks and the waves .
`` Of course , << there >> was nothing you could do , but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen '' , Mousie Chandler said to Linda Stuart .
Then << there >> was a spat over something , as there had been lovers' spats before ; ;
Then there was a spat over something , as << there >> had been lovers' spats before ; ;
And then << there >> was Linda's engagement to Bobbie Evans .
There was nothing specifically wrong with Edythe , but << there >> was absolutely nothing right about her either .
Bobbie and Linda looked magnificent at << their >> wedding .
John's mother died not long after his marriage , and << there >> was even less Cooper money left .
When << there >> was bridge at Edythe's house , the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers .
And Linda felt capable of capturing the affection of the children , anxious even , since she and Bobbie had had none of << their >> own .
They had << their >> first real fight , and Bobbie went off to get drunk .
But jolly old Uncle Donald would tell her no more than that Bobbie had certainly been considered for the job , but << there >> were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldn't understand .
And the other people << there >> were listening ! !
Old Mr. Thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job , Wally confessed , and couldn't get one because << there >> were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired .
They had not only spent every cent -- they were in debt up to << their >> necks , owing on everything they owned .
On top of everything else they were two months behind on << their >> apartment rent , and the day Wally received written notice that he was fired , they were evicted .
But , darn it all , why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down << their >> noses at us ? ?
It just seemed as if << there >> was nothing else to do .
She'd been out with Pete the night before and her gay chatter about << their >> date lightened my mood a little .
But << there >> was something about her -- and I felt my lips forming a name .
Once again , << there >> was a negative shake .
Again << there >> was something familiar about her , something --
`` Here and << there >> .
I never got << there >> .
I didn't much care if she were << there >> or not .
Her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and << there >> was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them .
I liked her , and all at once I was glad she was << there >> .
In her mind's eye -- her imagination responding fully , almost exhaustingly , to these shores' peculiar powers of stimulation -- she saw the city as from above , telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked , aqueducts and tombs , here a cypress , << there >> a pine , and all around the low blue hills .
The azaleas were as large as shrubs , and << their >> myriad blooms , many still tight in the bud , ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink , along with many white ones too .
I'm supposed to care as much now as then , as much here as << there >> , she realized , with a sigh .
There they all did << their >> uttermost to help Cousin Elec get a cramp out of his foot .
`` Of course ( George's letter continued ) , << there >> are practical problems to be considered .
But << there >> is more in this than meets the eye .
They wore shoes with pointed toes , odd to American eyes , and narrow trousers , and << their >> hair looked unnaturally black and slick .
The trouble is , Theresa thought , that while everything that happens << there >> is supposed to matter supremely , nothing here is supposed even to exist .
`` Oh put it << there >> '' ! !
And , though at the time I blushed to admit it even to myself , << there >> was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that Johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever triggered .
Astonishingly enough , it was my own voice I heard << there >> in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me .
After the meeting , << there >> was going to be a party at someone's house .
I assumed Alma would get me << there >> , but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up , we were separated .
Outside the hall , I anxiously looked around for her , then all at once << there >> was a hand on my elbow .
C'mon , let's find out where << they're >> keeping the glasses '' .
but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew , too , that << there >> was no pill to cure it .
Pink , Vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to << their >> infancy .
Surely << there >> was a better word .
On the beach , << there >> were pale girls and not-so-pale girls .
The Anniston players and << their >> manager ran out on the field .
`` One more and I'm coming out << there >> '' ! !
You're not in the big leagues , but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up << there >> '' ? ?
Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out << there >> .
`` Did you think << there >> were two '' ? ?
`` Well , it's at Fudomae and << there >> was a tan young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool .
I've been << there >> a number of times .
And the man who brought sweet potatoes into Kanto is buried << there >> , next to a beautiful seated statue of Fudo .
`` But the point is '' , Charlotte said , `` << there >> he was , freezing , naked in a little stream of water at Ryusenji , all in worship of Fudo , the god of fire '' .
The sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been << there >> before but he knew he had not , and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach .
The black Fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and Richard's eyes were caught by the Fudo's in fascination , and then Richard was shocked as , all at once , flames shot out from the sharp features of Fudo's face and << there >> was a terrible metallic scraping sound , as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it .
I had killed snakes before , when I was younger , but << there >> had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die .
I picked him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and I could feel the coolness of that radiant , fire-colored body , like splendid ice , and I knew that he had eaten only recently because << there >> were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him , like fieldmice swallowed whole might make .
The boy was << there >> at the lower corner of the field , and he was in the plowed earth , stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience .
I drove the tractor on , not looking down << there >> ; ;
My head began to ache , and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , << there >> are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they vanish .
He waited << there >> and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day .
I saw then , too , the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil , through something << there >> where I had been not long before .
`` You know << there >> are no poisonous snakes in this area .
<< there >> was a contorted ugliness now ; ;
He's -- he's just << there >> , that's all '' .
`` Yes , he's just << there >> .
No doubt Dolores resented following in << their >> footsteps .
He saw later that they had made << their >> marriage too quickly .
`` I think you'll get tired of them << there >> '' .
Then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still << there >> .
A glissade of giggles slid over << their >> voices .
At last << there >> was a void no one could fill .
He could even recall the last time he sat << there >> .
`` Well '' , he said , `` << there >> is Freddy , you know .
If we don't take care , the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides , brandishing << their >> cudgels '' .
They took nearly a month to investigate , marshal statistics , and put << their >> arguments down in black and white .
`` All the in-laws have got to have << their >> day '' , Adam said , and glared at William and Freddy in turn .
On << their >> way , they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants .
Finally , at Ye Olde Gasse Filling Station on Avocado Avenue , they learned that << their >> man , having paused to get oil for his car , had asked about the route to San Diego .
At the moment , Barco's back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his convertible which , in << their >> quest for the stolen lap rug , they proceeded to search .
During the return trip , Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases , such as : `` They're under sand dunes They're better off , I tell you I saved << their >> souls '' .
So he paid a call on Barco in his cell and began << their >> chat by stating bluntly :
I can lead you to every one of the bodies , and << there >> ain't four , nor five , nor six of 'em -- there's seven ! !
It wasn't long before I sensed that << there >> was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for Viola's destruction .
One day over a year before , << there >> had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel .
As Viola sat << there >> , a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and , as a prank , insert rosebuds between the toes .
No matter if your children are at the movies , in school , visiting << their >> grandmother , or on a field trip in some distant city , they will be upon you magically within seconds after you pick up the phone .
They had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , plumber , and sitter to call ( not that << there >> was much of a choice , since Catatonia was just a village ; ;
They had bought << their >> house in Catatonia after investigating all the regions of suburbia surrounding New York ; ;
I admired << their >> easy way of doing things but I couldn't escape an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things .
I admired their easy way of doing things but I couldn't escape an uneasiness at << their >> way of always doing the right things .
Their two boys were `` well adjusted '' and , like << their >> parents , always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences .
Francesca and Herbert considered themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling << their >> Colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things ) .
It seemed , indeed , that << their >> house was not so much a home , but rather a perfect stage set , and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play , and had talent enough to fill the roles competently , with nice understatement .
She always let it be known that << there >> was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy , and that Koussevitzky's second cousin was an intimate of theirs .
people who would give << their >> teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person '' ; ;
