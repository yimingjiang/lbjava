In both cases the stubborn fact remains : liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates , both legitimate offspring of << its >> loins , and when brought to the test , it behaved shabbily .
Emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him : he walked out of the Unitarian communion , so that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve << its >> self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration .
The fact is incontestable : that liberal world of Unitarian Boston was narrow-minded , intellectually sterile , smug , afraid of the logical consequences of << its >> own mild ventures into iconoclasm , and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened .

There can be no doubt , the Boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing << its >> canons of behavior .
The gentle Channing , revered by all Bostonians , orthodox or Unitarian , wrote to a friend in Louisville that among << its >> many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit , that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action : `` No city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment .
Our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of << its >> Christian survival , that of the literal , factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the Four Gospels .
The next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the Christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly `` science '' , and I submitted to << its >> conditions according to Christ's invitation and promise that , `` If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself '' ( John 7 : 17 ) .

In fact , during the first century B.C. , an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects , finding << its >> typical expression in the so-called `` wei books '' , a number of which were specifically devoted to the Lo Shu and related numerical diagrams , especially in connection with divination .

The importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and << its >> special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it .
Then , if the middle number is activated to << its >> greatest potential in terms of this square , through multiplying it by the highest number , 9 ( which is the square of the base number ) , the result is 45 ; ;
Furthermore , the middle number of the Lo Shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of << its >> central position ; ;
Whereas the primary meanings of the Lo Shu diagram seemed to have been based on << its >> inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded Chinese thought .

The second involves something deeper , but << its >> characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for the community , not in the truth on which the community rests .
Thus in both types attention is focused on the community itself , and << its >> phenomenological life .
The third type , however , wrenches attention from the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the ground of being on which the community depends for << its >> existence .
It has lost << its >> ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances .
Relativism and equality are << its >> characteristic diseases .
Precisely at the moment when it has lost << its >> vision the mind of the community turns out from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure itself .
The liberal-conservative split , to define it further , derives from a basic difference concerning the existential status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads to << its >> identification .
Its ontological status is itself most tenuous because apart from individual men , who are << its >> `` matter '' , tradition , the `` form '' of society exists only as a shared perception of truth .
Its essence lies in << its >> attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces .
To this end political authority is called upon to exercise << its >> negative and coercive powers .

The basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in << its >> realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational .

In the early months of 1714 , the battle between Swift and Steele over the issue of the Succession entered << its >> major phase .
Steele lost his seat in Parliament , and his personal quarrel with Swift , by now a public issue , thus reached << its >> climax .
In his effort to stir the public from << its >> lethargy , Steele goes so far as to list Catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected in the event of a Stuart Restoration , and , with rousing rhetoric , he asserts that the only preservation from these `` Terrours '' is to be found in the laws he has so tediously cited .
If `` Jack the Courtier '' is really to be taken as Swift , the following remark is obviously Steele's comment on Swift's change of parties and << its >> effect on their friendship : `` I assure you , dear Jack , when I first found out such an Allay in you , as makes you of so malleable a Constitution , that you may be worked into any Form an Artificer pleases , I foresaw I should not enjoy your Favour much longer '' .

This understanding , of course , may in << its >> turn take many forms and some of these -- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative literature -- are essentially historical .
Thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical of << its >> period .
Again , he may discover embodied within << its >> texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways .

In addition , he believed in the `` dramatic unity and separateness of the period from 1702-14 , lying between the Stuart and Hanoverian eras with a special ethos of << its >> own '' .

Childhood's End -- apparently indebted to Kurd Lasswitz's Utopian romance , Auf Zwei Planeten ( 1897 ) , and also to Wells's Histories Of The Future , especially , The World Set Free ( 1914 ) and The Shape Of Things To Come ( 1933 ) -- describes the bloodless conquest of earth by the Overlords , vastly superior creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for << its >> next stage of development , an eventual merging with the composite mind of the universe .
Because of the means of publication -- science-fiction magazines and cheap paperbacks -- and because dystopian science fiction is still appearing in quantity the full range and extent of this phenomenon can hardly be known , though one fact is evident : the science-fiction imagination has been immensely fertile in << its >> extrapolations .
Frederick Pohl's `` The Midas Touch '' ( 1954 ) predicts an economy of abundance which , in order to remain prosperous , must set << its >> robots to consuming surplus production ; ;
Nevertheless , with all these qualifications and exceptions , the current dystopian phenomenon remains impressive for << its >> criticism that science and technology , instead of bringing utopia , may well enslave , dehumanize , and even destroy men .
Easily the best known of these three novels is The Space Merchants , a good example of a science-fiction dystopia which extrapolates much more than the impact of science on human life , though << its >> most important warning is in this area , namely as to the use to which discoveries in the behavioral sciences may be put .
The consequences , of course , have been dreadful : reckless expansion has led to overpopulation , pollution of the earth and depletion of << its >> natural resources .
While The Space Merchants indicates , as Kingsley Amis has correctly observed , some of the `` impending consequences of the growth of industrial and commercial power '' and satirizes `` existing habits in the advertising profession '' , << its >> warning and analysis penetrate much deeper .
And this , of course , is exactly what Madison Avenue has been accused of doing albeit in a primitive way , with << its >> `` hidden persuaders '' and what the space merchants accomplish with much greater sophistication and precision .

When the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached << its >> 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world .
With << its >> history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution , Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder , Joseph R. Brown , and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology .

Brown , and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology .
the company became `` J. R. Brown & Sharpe '' , and entered into a new and important period of << its >> development .
Thus was invented the single thread sewing machine , which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. Willcox decided to bring to Brown & Sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake << its >> manufacture .
The new work was a boon to the partnership , not only for << its >> own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment .
The original machine , bearing << its >> famous serial number , is still on exhibition at the Brown & Sharpe Precision Center in Providence .
During the Civil War period Mr. Brown also invented the Brown & Sharpe formed tooth gear cutter , a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's gear manufacturing industry by changing << its >> basic economics .
Although Mr. Brown was not himself << its >> inventor ( it was a French idea ) , it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use .
So it was that when Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe first saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in 1868 , they brought a sample with them to the United States and started Brown & Sharpe in yet another field where it retains << its >> leadership to this day .
That achievement was his creation of the universal grinding machine , which made << its >> appearance in 1876 at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition .
This machine , like << its >> milling counterpart , was the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world .
As head of the firm Darling & Swartz , Mr. Darling began by challenging Brown & Sharpe to << its >> keenest competition during the 1850's and early 60's .
Perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of Mr. Brown's tradition for accuracy was Mr. Oscar J. Beale , whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of Mr. Brown , and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled Brown & Sharpe to manufacture gages , and therefore << its >> products , with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world .

The model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that << its >> wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny .
The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of << its >> implications .
Part 1 , below describes this abstract model by spelling out << its >> assumptions .
The industry of this model is so important that << its >> wage and price policies are affected with a public interest .
Because of << its >> importance , and because the lack of price competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases .
Because of its importance , and because the lack of price competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise << its >> price any more than could be justified by cost increases .
For such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise << its >> price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs ( due to rising wages , etc. ) .
Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of << its >> sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure .
The single union which faces the industry does not restrict << its >> membership , and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate .
The union does not regard unemployment of << its >> own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy -- its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment .
The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting << its >> own wage policy -- its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment .
The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy -- << its >> concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment .
We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate increases , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from << its >> own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate .
A nation such as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect << its >> neutrality ; ;

In an earlier case , Kingan & Co. v. United States , an American corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a British corporation in exchange for << its >> own stock and then liquidating the British corporation .
In virtually every case the transferor corporation is liquidated , and << its >> former stockholders either own outright , or have a continuing stock interest in , the assets which gave rise to the tax .
In the rare case where a corporation's only substantial asset , or << its >> most important one , is a claim for refund , perhaps its transfer should not be permitted , whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock .
In the rare case where a corporation's only substantial asset , or its most important one , is a claim for refund , perhaps << its >> transfer should not be permitted , whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock .
For example , property `` used in the trade or business '' of a transferor corporation , as defined in section 1231 , presumably would not retain << its >> special status following a non-taxable reorganization if it is not so used in the business of the acquiring corporation .
The parent of a group filing consolidated returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization defined in section 368(a)(1) , but as a different corporation for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation which had not , for example , elected to file consolidated returns with << its >> own subsidiaries .

Most of us remember and think of the Wagner-Peyser Act in << its >> historical sense , as a major milestone in the development of public placement services .
However , when labor disputes arise , << its >> provisions come clearly into play .
Other provisions of the Act empower the Secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out << its >> provisions , and he has done so .
However , the Federal Court held that since the State had accepted the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act into << its >> own Code , and presumably therefore also the regulations , it was now a State matter .
The impact of noncompliance under the Wagner-Peyser Act is clear : the withdrawal of some $11 million a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service program or , as a corollary , the taking over by the Federal Government of << its >> operation .

Thus , the Commission acted with a sense of social responsibility within the area of << its >> own convictions about the problem of government support to private education .
The first , or double-step , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of << its >> application to railroads ( and other transportation agencies ) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission .
But in any event , full credit should be given to the Cost Section for << its >> express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost analyses : namely , that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service ; ;
In order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis , let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by << its >> own steam-generation plant .
If this threefold division of costs were to have << its >> counterpart in the actual rates of charge for service , as it actually does have in some rates , there would result a three-part rate for any one class of service .
Like primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon << its >> operational worth .
Such a position entails the negation of philosophy in << its >> Platonic form as something soaring above and embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences .
The relinquishing by philosophy of pretentious claims to empirical priority gives it an ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was unable to examine because of << its >> missionary attitude to knowledge of more humble sorts .
Beyond this , philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry , but within << its >> potential domain of relevance .
Likewise , Kant formulated the nebular hypothesis , according to which the solar system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent gas , nearly a half century before << its >> scientific value was made plain by Laplace in his Systeme Du Monde .

) Whatever philosophy is conceived to be , << its >> rationalist , logistic attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is something other than science .
In addition to the incompleteness of science and the completeness of metaphysics , they differ in that science is essentially descriptive , while philosophy in << its >> inherited forms , tends to be goal-oriented , teleological and prescriptive .
A philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals << its >> acquiescence in the shortcomings of men , an impatience with partial , tentative solutions .
Let us suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all , but that we mistakenly believe it did , and say as before that << its >> suffering was an evil thing .
In the only sense in which badness is involved at all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in << its >> entirety , since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling , and that feeling is still there .
This way of escape is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties of << its >> own and has not , so far as I know , been urged by positivists , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it .
When we come upon the rabbit and make our remark about << its >> suffering being a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; ;
This circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes << its >> exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever .
Instead , he constantly became lost in parts and components of them , confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects , and so on , unless he allowed time to `` trace '' the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover << its >> contours .
If , however , the figure to be discerned were complicated , composed of several interlocking subfigures , and so on , even the tracing process failed him , and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among << its >> parts .
and this he could do only by going over << its >> mass with the tracing procedure .
Men , trees , automobiles , houses , and so on -- objects continually confronted in everyday life -- had each << its >> characteristic blot-appearance and became easily recognizable , at the very beginning of tracing , by an inference as to what each was .
In the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in << its >> internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world .

One can take a vase of about 800 B.C. and , without any knowledge of << its >> place of origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; ;
the ceramic material of the age is more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative of the hopes and fears of << its >> makers , who begin to show scenes of human life and death .
Greek civilization was swirling toward << its >> great revolution , in which the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth .
The Manchester Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for << its >> maintenance .
Fire District No. 1 discussed << its >> possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment .
The 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with << its >> attendant facilities .
There the matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to << its >> main streams .
The line soon lived up to << its >> name , as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital stock .

Marsden was manager of the company for ten years and manager of << its >> successor company , the Colonial Light and Power Company , for one year .
At about the time the Marsden enterprise was getting under way , the Vail Light and Lumber Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present Bennington Co-operative Creamery , intending to use << its >> surplus power for generating electricity .
Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ Church and Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now << its >> most eminent proponent .
But to return to the main line of our inquiry , it is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr -- indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that << its >> author was a martyr .
Moreover , it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial impetus to Plato's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with << its >> ruling-class communism of goods , wives , and children , was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche ; ;
To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from << its >> medieval successors-in-spirit , the monastic communities , is with an appropriate shift of adjectives , misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato's Republic : in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes , in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes .
Whatever the merits of << its >> intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist .
If it failed on occasion to elect << its >> candidates for general state offices by majorities , the failure was due to a lingering remnant of the Know-Nothing party , which called itself the American Republican party .
In << its >> account of the Trafton lecture , the Providence Daily Post said that the remarks of Rev. Trafton made the people indignant .
It was for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate << its >> texture in paint .

And the surface is driven back , in << its >> very surfaceness , only by this contrast .
Depicted , Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal , undepicted kind , but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind -- and it does so , moreover , without depriving the latter of << its >> literalness ; ;
Cubism , in << its >> 1911-1912 phase ( which the French , with justice , call `` hermetic '' ) was on the verge of abstract art .

Boris' first entrance seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the Coronation Scene , with << its >> dazzling confusion of tonalities .
We have a brief glimpse of the Tsar's public personality , the `` official Boris '' , but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd -- a significant contrast with << its >> halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene , its bitter resentment and fury in the final act .

Even in << its >> most conventional appearance , the guests' song of praise to Marina , there are a few female dissenters criticizing the princess for her coldness .
They will kneel and plead for Boris' leadership in a strangely intense song , << its >> phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath , but when the police with their cudgels move away , they mock and grumble and fight among themselves .
Again , as Boris feels himself nearing death , a procession files into the hall singing a hymn , << its >> modal harmonies adding a churchly touch to the grim atmosphere : The words are hardly calculated to put the Tsar's mind at ease .
Critically invisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by << its >> effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency .
Uninhibited lyricism should be distinguished from << its >> exact opposite -- the sterile , extraneous invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals , or present blight of poetic professors .
It is curious that at << its >> best , the work of this school of painting -- Mark Rothko , Jackson Pollock , Clyfford Still , Robert Motherwell , Willem De-Kooning , and the rest -- resembles nothing so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive painters : the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background of a Henry McFee , itself a formula derived from Renoir ; ;
At << its >> best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo decorative surface .
With a few important and a few more unimportant exceptions , no expression can be deemed le mot juste for << its >> context , because each was very probably the only expression that long-established practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow .
In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to << its >> art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative .
But only in one of << its >> aspects is Great Expectations a tale of violence , revenge , and retribution .
An RDW will be of the form Af , where xxxx is the starting location of the area and yyyy is << its >> ending location .
Grab samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine << its >> operating conditions .
While one element is announcing progress , another is delineating << its >> problems .
Industry's main criticism of the Navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot determine where any one company or industry can apply << its >> skills and know-how .

Therefore the second principle of the plan must be that , while providing for all-out hostilities , << its >> effectiveness is not dependent on general war .
The submarine has increased << its >> effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since World War 2 .
To this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense has been demonstrated , the mission has been stated , broad principles delineating << its >> content laid down , and the supporting elements listed .

Experiments carried out over long periods of time in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the onset of contraction and << its >> completion are confined to an interval of several degrees Centigrade and to a concentration range of only several per cent .
While ATP appears to be necessary for the occurrence of contraction , << its >> presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it by the muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for contraction .

Spoilage by chemical action results from the reaction of one group of components in the food with others or with << its >> environment , as in corrosion of the walls of metal containers or the reaction of fats with oxygen in the air to produce rancidity .
It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the cutting removal of a coating from << its >> substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the coating .
It was found that the coating is separated from << its >> substrate entirely by cohesive failure .
From Fig. 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be derived and the cutting force is Af where **yl is the shear strength of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material , W is the width of the removed coating and T is << its >> thickness .
Since the mid 1950s , when urethane foam first made << its >> appearance in the American market , growth has been little short of fantastic .
Thermal conductivity is directly traceable to the material's porous , air-cell construction which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which form << its >> composition .

The music arrived , taking him << its >> rhythm .

We tumbled to a stop in Deacon Gordon's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in << its >> middle .
We were less than a quarter of a mile from the road , and we could trace << its >> shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it .

He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by << its >> sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values .

Added to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot , she might even have drunk some of it , she wouldn't have taken enough to kill her , for she would have been warned by << its >> taste .
